About This Manual
The Master |ndex provides an index for the most commonly used books in
the Compaq Tru64™ UNIX documentation set. Books with index entries in
the Master Index are listed in Table 1.
Audience
This book is for anyone who needs to access information about the Tru64
UNIX operating system. It can help you find a specific topic in the
documentation set by pointing you to the location in the book where the
topic is discussed.
New and Changed Features
Beginning with this release, you can search the HTML version of the Master
Index using a keyword search. To open the keyword search page, click on the
“Search the Master Index” subentry under Master Index in the General User
Documents list in the Online Documentation Library.
To perform a keyword search, enter the word or phrase you want tofind. The
search function searches the entire Master Index for matches, and displays
the results. When you click on an entry in the search results, the target book
opens in its own window. In most cases, the book opens to the place in the
text that is indicated by the entry.
Conventions
In the printed and PDF versions of the Master Index, each master index
page reference is preceded by an abbreviated book title. For example, the
following entry points to page 3-2 in the book Sharing Software on a Local
Area Network:
installation
RIS software subset, SharingSW 3-2
Table 1 maps the abbreviated title for each book to its complete book title.
The HTML version of the Master Index does not contain page numbers.
Instead, the abbreviated book title appears as a hot link. Clicking on this
link takes you either to the beginning of the book being referenced or, in
many cases, to the actual location of the information in the book. Most
entries also provide section numbers, to help you further refine your search.
