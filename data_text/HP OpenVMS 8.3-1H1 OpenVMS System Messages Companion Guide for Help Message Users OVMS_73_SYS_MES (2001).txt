‘variable’ In message text, apostrophes delimit a variable field that is
replaced with an actual value when the message is issued.
Ctrl/x A sequence such as Ctrl/x indicates that you must hold down
the key labeled Ctrl while you press another key or a pointing
device button.
PF1x A sequence such as PF1 x indicates that you must first press
and release the key labeled PF1 and then press and release
another key or a pointing device button.
Return In examples, a key name enclosed in a box indicates that
you press a key on the keyboard. (In text, a key name is not
enclosed in a box.)
In the HTML version of this document, this convention appears
as brackets, rather than a box.
A horizontal ellipsis in examples indicates one of the following
possibilities:
¢ Additional optional arguments in a statement have been
omitted.
¢ The preceding item or items can be repeated one or more
times.
e Additional parameters, values, or other information can be
entered.
A vertical ellipsis indicates the omission of items from a code
example or command format; the items are omitted because
they are not important to the topic being discussed.
In command format descriptions, parentheses indicate that you
must enclose choices in parentheses if you specify more than
one.
xi

[] In command format descriptions, brackets indicate optional
choices. You can choose one or more items or no items.
Do not type the brackets on the command line. However,
you must include the brackets in the syntax for OpenVMS
directory specifications and for a substring specification in an
assignment statement.
In command format descriptions, vertical bars separate choices
within brackets or braces. Within brackets, the choices are
optional; within braces, at least one choice is required. Do not
type the vertical bars on the command line.
{} In command format descriptions, braces indicate required
choices; you must choose at least one of the items listed. Do
not type the braces on the command line.
bold text This typeface represents the introduction of a new term. It
also represents the name of an argument, an attribute, or a
reason.
italic text Italic text indicates important information, complete titles
of manuals, or variables. Variables indude information that
varies in system output (Internal error number), in command
lines ((PRODUCER=name), and in command parameters in
text (where dd represents the predefined code for the device
type).

Tutorial Information
The chapters in this part of the manual provide tutorial information about
OpenVMS system messages and explain how to use the Help Message utility to
access online message descriptions.

1
Overview of OpenVMS System Messages
The OpenVMS operating system provides a centralized error message facility.
When you type a command at the terminal or execute an image that results in an
error, the system locates the message associated with the error and displays it.
The Help Message (MSGHLP) utility, described in Chapter 2, allows you to
access online messages documentation from the DCL prompt. Part II of this
manual describes messages that can occur before the operating system and Help
Message are fully functional. Messages are ordered alphabetically by message
identification (see Section 1.1); exceptions to this rule are noted in Section 1.1.1.
For users who do not have Help Message installed, Section 1.3 explains how
to retrieve a system message. This chapter also describes how to recover from
typical error conditions (see Section 1.5).
1.1 Format of System Messages
Most messages displayed by the OpenVMS operating system have the following
format:
Sfacility-s-identification, text
[-facility-s-identification, text]
A percent sign (%) prefixes the main message, and a hyphen (-) prefixes any
secondary messages that provide additional information about the error.
For example, the HELP/MESSAGE command calls OpenVMS Record
Management Services (RMS) to access the database. If the database file cannot
be found, the MSGHLP facility displays a message indicating that it cannot
access the file; an RMS message and a SYSTEM message follow to indicate the
reason for the failure. In the following example, a HELP/MESSAGE command
includes the /LIBRARY qualifier to specify a private database, which MSGHLP
cannot find:
$ HELP /MESSAGE/LIBRARY=TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA ACCVIO
SMSGHLP-F-MDFERR, error accessing Help Message database file "TOOLS: [MYPROJ]
MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA"
-RMS-E-FNF, file not found
-SYSTEM-W-NOSUCHFILE, no such file
Any or all of the message fields can be suppressed by using the SET MESSAGE
command (see online help or the Op VMS DCL Dictionary). The message fields
are as follows:
facility
An OpenVMS facility or component name.
Overview of OpenVMS System Messages 1-1

Overview of OpenVMS System Messages
1.1 Format of System Messages
s
A severity level indicator having one of the following values:
Code Meaning Description
S Success The system has successfully performed your request. In some
cases, the command processing continues after the message is
issued.
| Information The system has performed your request. The message
provides information about the process.
WwW Warning The command may have performed some, but not all, of
your request. The message may suggest that you verify the
command or the program output.
E Error The output or program result is incorrect, but the system may
attempt to continue execution.
F Fatal (severe) The system cannot continue to execute the request.
identification
A one-word code identifying the message—often an abbreviation of the message
text. Messages described in this manual are typically alphabetized by message
identification. Section 1.1.1 describes some exceptions.
text
Text of the message; usually describes the condition that produced the message.
1.1.1 Messages with Different Formats
Some messages have no identification. Others have no facility code, severity
level, or identification. In this manual, such messages are alphabetized by the
first word in the message—whether it is the facility name or the message text.
Facilities that often include the facility name, but no identification, in their
messages are:
e« System Bootstrap Facility (SYSBOOT)
¢« System Initialization (SYSINIT)
For example, the following message is alphabetized under “SY SBOOT-E-Device”:
SYSBOOT-E-Device names not allowed
The following facilities display some or all of their messages without facility
name, severity level, and identification:
¢ Cluster port driver
e« System Bugcheck
For example, the following cluster port driver message is alphabetized under
“Port”:
Port Power Down
1-2 Overview of OpenVMS System Messages

Overview of OpenVMS System Messages
1.2 System Reporting of Messages
1.2 System Reporting of Messages
Messages are displayed on the current device, which is identified by the logical
name SYS$OUTPUT. For an interactive user, this device is normally the
terminal; for batch job users, it is the batch job log file
If the logical device SYS$ERROR is different from SYS$OUTPUT, the system
writes informational, warning, error, and fatal system messages to that device as
well. For example, if you execute a command procedure interactively and specify
the /OUTPUT qualifier, the system defines the file you specified as SYS $OUTPUT
for the procedure. SYS$ERROR remains assigned to your current error device.
Then, if any errors occur during the execution of the command procedure, the
error messages are displayed on your terminal and are entered in the specified
file.
1.3 Retrieving a System Message
When a DCL command, command procedure, or applications program completes
execution, it returns a condition code. The condition code indicates the execution
status of the command—whether it executed successfully or resulted in an error.
Each condition code corresponds to a system message. The command interpreter
saves the condition code as a 32-bit longword defined as the reserved global
symbol $STATUS. The condition code stored in $STATUS is a hexadecimal
number conforming to the format of an OpenVMS message code:
e Bits 0-2 contain the severity level of the message.
¢ Bits 3-15 contain the number of the corresponding message.
¢ Bits 16-27 contain a number for the software component, or facility, that
generated the message.
¢ Bits 28-31 contain internal control flags.
By default, the HELP/MESSAGE command accesses the value stored in $STATUS
and displays the corresponding message. The following paragraphs explain how
you can access similar information if the Help Message utility is not installed on
your system.
The lexical function FSMESSAGE returns the message associated with a
condition code. To display the message for the current code on the default output
device, use the following command:
$ WRITE SYSSOUTPUT FSMESSAGE (SSTATUS)
SSYSTEM-F-POWERFAIL, power failure occurred
If you prefer to obtain the current value of $STATUS, use this command:
$ SHOW SYMBOL SSTATUS
SSTATUS == "%X00000364"
If you know the condition code for a message, you can use F$¢MESSAGE to
translate the code to its associated message. For example:
$ WRITE SYSSOUTPUT FSMESSAGE (%X00000001)
SSYSTEM-S-NORMAL, normal successful completion
You can omit leading zeros when specifying a code to F$MESSAGE. However, the
characters “%X” are necessary to identify a numeral as hexadecimal.

1.4 Exception Conditions
1.4 Exception Conditions
During the execution of an image, the image can incur a fatal error known as an
exception condition. When an exception condition occurs, the system takes special
action.
If the image has not declared a condition handler, the system forces the image
to exit and displays a message indicating the reason for the exception. The
message includes the contents of these locations at the time of the exception: the
program counter (PC) and processor status (PS) on OpenVMS Alpha systems, or
the program counter (PC) and processor status longword (PSL) on OpenVMS VAX
systems. This message is followed by a traceback; the system displays the status
of the call frames on the stack so that you can locate the procedure where the
condition occurred. Refer to the ODVMS Programming Concepts Manual for a
more detailed discussion of condition handling.
1.5 Recovery Procedures
Error messages generally occur for the following reasons:
« A command is entered incorrectly; it contains a spelling or syntax error or an
incorrect file specification. (See Section 1.5.1.)
¢ A required resource is currently unavailable. (See Section 1.5.2.)
¢ A programming error is detected during the execution of an image. (See
Section 1.5.3.)
e« A system software or hardware problem exists. (See Section 1.5.4.)
1.5.1 Recovering from Command Entry Errors
When an error occurs following interactive command entry, you must reenter the
command. Messages from the command interpreter are usually followed by a
display of the portion of the command line that is rejected. Correct this portion of
the line before you reenter the command.
Errors that occur while a command is executing can indicate that you have
entered an invalid value for a parameter or qualifier. In these cases, you can use
the DCL command HELP or consult the Op&VMS DCL Dictionary to determine
the legal values before you try to reenter the command.
Errors in file specifications or device names can occur when you enter a file name
in a command that has a default file type, but the file name is currently defined
as a logical name. When the system translates the logical name, the resulting file
specification may not be valid within the context of the command.
The syntax of the file specification can be invalid for any of the following reasons:
e« A device name is not terminated with a colon.
¢ A directory name is not enclosed in brackets.
¢ A file name has more than 39 characters.
e A file type has more than 39 characters.
e An alphabetic version number is specified.
¢ A node name is included and contains nonalphanumeric characters.
e A connection to the target node could not be made.

1.5 Recovery Procedures
1.5.2 Responding to Unavailable Resources
If the Set Resource Wait Mode ($SETRWM) system service is enabled (default
mode) and a required resource such as dynamic memory is unavailable, the
process iS normally placed in a wait state until the resource becomes available.
However, under certain program conditions, the programmer can choose to
disable the resource wait mode so that when such a condition occurs, control
returns immediately to the calling program with an error status.
Other resources such as files, privileges, or devices are not subject to resource
wait mode, and their unavailability or absence always causes an error.
How a program responds to the unavailability of a resource depends primarily on
the application and the particular service called. In some instances, the program
may be able to continue execution and retry the service later. Or, it may be
necessary only to note that the program is required to wait.
1.5.3 Recovering from Programming Errors
If a program image terminates abnormally, you can get some information
about the error from the message. When a program image exits, the command
interpreter uses the current value of general register 0 to obtain information
about the exit status. If it is an abnormal (or error) exit, the system message
associated with the register 0 value is displayed.
Programming errors can be caused by the following conditions:
¢ Incorrect coding of arguments for called procedures (for example, system
services)
e Logic errors in programming
e Failure to establish the correct execution environment before executing the
image (for example, failure to make logical name assignments for input or
output files or devices)
The OpenVMS Debugger can help you discover and correct programming errors.
For details on how to use the debugger, refer to the OpenVMS Debugger Manual.
1.5.4 Reporting System Software or Hardware Errors
When a message notifies you that a system software or hardware error has
occurred, action is required by the system operator or system manager. If a
hardware device is not operational, inform the system manager. If you encounter
a software error, keep any system dump files and other relevant information, and
contact a Compaq support representative.

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
Help Message (MSGHLP) is a versatile utility that allows you to quickly access
online descriptions of system messages from the DCL prompt on a character-cell
terminal (including DECterm windows).
Help Message displays descriptions of messages produced by the OpenVMS
operating system. In addition, the Help Message database can optionally include
other source files, such as user-supplied messages documentation.
The HELP/MESSAGE command and qualifiers are described in the following
sections, including an overview of the facility's features and examples of a few
simple operations. Detailed information about customizing the Help Message
database follows the qualifier descriptions. System managers can refer to the
OpenVMS Systen Manager’s Manual for more information about customizing the
Help Message database.
2.1 Features of Help Message
Basic Help Message features are as follows:
e By default, Help Message provides information on the status of the last
executed DCL command. To obtain message information after a DCL
command results in an error, enter the following:
$ HELP/MESSAGE
You can abbreviate the command according to standard conventions or define
a key to evoke the basic HELP/MESSAGE command.
« Help Message preserves the value of $STATUS, so you can incorporate the
HELP/MESSAGE command into a command procedure to obtain additional
information about errors. For example, you could include a command similar
to the following:
$ IF .NOT. S$STATUS THEN HELP /MESSAGE
e« The default HELP/MESSAGE command operates on the value currently
stored in $STATUS. You can also access a message description by explicitly
specifying a status value in either decimal or hexadecimal. For example:
$ HELP/MESSAGE/STATUS=12
$ HELP/MESSAGE/STATUS=%XC
¢« You can also access message descriptions by specifying the message identifier
or other words from the message text in any order. For example, the following
commands both access ACCVIO messages:
$ HELP/MESSAGE ACCVIO
$ HELP/MESSAGE VIRTUAL ACCESS
¢ By default, HELP/MESSAGE matches all words beginning with the specified
search string. You can refine a search to match exact words only.
Help Message Utility (MSGHLP) 2-1

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
2.1 Features of Help Message
In the following example, the first command outputs all messages containing
words beginning with the ACC string, while the second command selects only
those messages that contain ACC as a whole word. You can use Ctrl/Z to quit
out of any undesired long list of messages—or to terminate any other Help
Message operation.
$ HELP/MESSAGE/BRIEF ACC
$ HELP/MESSAGE/BRIEF/WORD_MATCH=WHOLE_WORD ACC
¢« To refine your search even further, you can specify that only messages
produced by a certain facility be displayed. For example, the following
command displays only the ACCVIO message produced by the SYSTEM
facility:
$ HELP/MESSAGE/FACILITY=SYSTEM ACCVIO
« You can also select all messages produced by one or more specified facilities.
To list the names of all facilities in the database, enter the following:
$ HELP/MESSAGE/FACILITY=?
You can specify any facility name from the resulting list as a value for the
/FACILITY qualifier. Specify /BRIEF to output a list of the messages only,
without descriptions. Adding /SORT alphabetizes the output. For example,
the following command alphabetically lists all the messages for the DTS
facility:
$ HELP/MESSAGE/BRIEF/SORT/FACILITY=DTS
For more information about specifying facility names using the /FACILITY
qualifier, see Section 2.3.
e By selecting the messages you want and directing them to a file, you can
create and print your own customized message documentation.
For example, the following command selects all messages issued by the
Backup utility and those messages documented as “Shared by several
facilities,” alphabetizes them, and outputs them to a printable file called
MESSAGES.TXT:
$ HELP/MESS(BAACKUGP, ESHA/REDF) /ASORCT/OIUTPLUT=IMESTSAGYES= . TXT
e You can define a logical name in your login file to override a system-defined
search path for the Help Message database and create a customized database
that includes your own message descriptions (see Section 2.5.2).
« You can add your own messages documentation to the Help Message database
(see Section 2.6.1).
« You can delete messages from the database (see Section 2.6.2).
e« Users with write access to Compaq supplied MSGHLP$DATA files (usually
the system manager) can further customize the Help Message database (for
example, add a comment to a Compaq supplied message description).
« You can exit out of any Help Message display by pressing Ctrl/Z.

2.2 HELP/MESSAGE Command and Qualifiers
The HELP/MESSAGE command and qualifiers are described in the following
section.
Help Message Utility (MSGHLP) 2-3

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
HELP/MESSAGE
HELP/MESSAGE
Displays descriptions of system messages.
Format
HELP/MESSAGE _[/qualifier [...]] [search-string]
Parameter
search-string
Specifies a message identifier or one or more words from a message's text. By
default, HELP/MESSAGE displays a description of the message produced by
the last executed command (that is, the message corresponding to the value
currently stored in the CLI symbol $STATUS). (Some exceptions are discussed in
Section 2.4.)
The Help Message utility (MSGHLP) operates on the search string using the
following conventions:
¢« Words containing fewer than three alphanumeric characters are ignored.
¢« Words can be specified in any order.
You can minimize search time by specifying the most unusual word first.
¢ Nonalphanumeric characters are ignored in the search. Exceptions are the
percent sign (%) and hyphen (-) when they prefix a message. Therefore, you
can paste a full message into the search string, provided you include these
special characters and delete any variables (such as file names) that were
inserted into the message.
If Help Message fails to find a pasted message in the database, submit the
command again and omit the leading special character, facility, and severity.
Some common messages are documented as "shared" messages rather than
facility-specific messages.
e« Help Message matches all words that begin with the characters specified in
the search string. Use WWORD_MATCH=WHOLE_WORD to specify that only
whole words be matched.
Qualifiers
/BRIEF
Outputs the message text only.
/DELETE=filename.MSGHLP
Deletes all messages contained in the specified .MSGHLP file from whichever of
the following files is found first:
« A MSGHLP$DATA file specified with the /LIBRARY qualifier
e The first .MSGHLP$DATA file in a search path specified by the /LIBRARY
qualifier
« The first .MSGHLP$DATA file in the default search path (defined by logical
name MSGHLP$LIBRARY )
« SYS$HELP:MSGHLP$LIBRARY.MSGHLP$DATA (the default
-MSGHLP$DATA file)
2-4 Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
HELP/MESSAGE
You must have write access to Compaq supplied .MSGHLP$DATA files to delete
messages from the Compaq supplied database.
Note
If you create a .MSGHLP file by specifying a search string, check
the output .MSGHLP file to be sure the search did not pick up any
unexpected messages that you do not want to delete from the database.
Edit any such messages out of the .MSGHLP file before you perform the
delete operation.
/EXTRACT=filename.MSGHLP
Extracts messages from the database and generates a .MSGHLP file that can
be edited, if desired, and used as input for /INSERT and /DELETE operations.
/EXTRACT retrieves data from a .MSGHLP$DATA file or logical search path
specified by /LIBRARY or, by default, from files in the search path defined
by logical name MSGHLP$LIBRARY. When /EXTRACT is not specified, Help
Message produces output in standard text format by default (see /OUTPUT).
/FACILITY=?
/FACILITY=(facility-name [,...])
/FACILITY=ALL
Specifies which facilities in the database are to be searched for a match.
Enter /FACILITY =? to output a list of all facilities in the default database or ina
database specified by /LIBRARY.
To narrow your search, specify one or more facility names with /FACILITY.
(Multiple facilities must be enclosed in parentheses and be separated by commas.)
Help Message then outputs only matching messages produced by the specified
facility or facilities.
Specify /FACILITY=ALL to output messages for all facilities in the database.
/FACILITY=ALL is the default unless another facility is implied; for example,
specifying /STATUS or defaulting to the value of the CLI symbol $STATUS
automatically identifies a specific facility. Similarly, cutting and pasting a
message that includes a facility name invalidates use of the /FACILITY qualifier.
/FULL (default)
Outputs the complete message description, including message text, facility name,
explanation, user action, and user-supplied comment, if any.
/INSERT=filename.MSGHLP
Updates the first of the following files to be found with new or changed
information from the specified .MSGHLP file:
« A .MSGHLP$DATA file specified with the /LIBRARY qualifier
e The first .MSGHLP$DATA file in a search path specified by the /LIBRARY
qualifier
Help Message Utility (MSGHLP) 2-5

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
HELP/MESSAGE
¢« The first .MSGHLP$DATA file in the default search path (defined by logical
name MSGHLP$LIBRARY )
¢ SYS$HELP:MSGHLP$LIBRARY.MSGHLP$DATA (the default
-MSGHLP$DATA file)
You must have write access for the Compaq supplied .MSGHLP$DATA files to
insert data into these files. User-supplied data is identified by change bars in
Help Message output.
/LIBRARY=disk:[directory]filename.MSGHLP$DATA
/LIBRARY=disk:[directory]
/LIBRARY=logical-name
Defines the messages database for the current command to be a particular
-.MSGHLP$DATA file, all the .MSGHLP$DATA files in a specified directory, or all
the files in a search path defined by a logical name.
For most operations, the default database is either
SYS$HELP:MSGHLP$LIBRARY.MSGHLP$DATA or a search path of
.MSGHLP$DATA files defined by logical name MSGHLP$LIBRARY.
For /DELETE and /INSERT operations, the default database is either
SYS$HELP:MSGHLP$LIBRARY.MSGHLP$DATA or the first file in a search
path defined by logical name MSGHLP$LIBRARY.
/OUTPUT=filespec
Writes output to the specified file. By default, Help Message writes output to
SYS$OUTPUT, which is normally the terminal.
/PAGE (default for screen display)
/NOPAGE
Displays terminal output one screen at a time. The page length is automatically
set to 1 line less than the value specified by SET TERMINAL/PAGE. (Use of
/PAGE is incompatible with /OUTPUT =filespec.)
/SECTION_FILE=*
/SECTION_FILE=file-spec
Identifies the specified message section file to the system so that Help Message
can interpret the $STATUS values for the messages in that file’ The default
file specification is SYS$MESSAGE:.EXE. Specifying /SECTION_FILE=*
automatically includes all OpenVM S-supplied message section files. For more
information, see Section 2.4.
Note
The results of using this qualifier are entirely independent from those
created by the SET MESSAGE command. The Help Message utility and
Message utility do not interact. You must separately code each utility to
obtain the results you want.
/SORT
/NOSORT (default)
Sorts output in alphabetical order. If a sort fails, retry the operation using the
/MWORK_FILES qualifier.
2-6 Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
HELP/MESSAGE
/STATUS=status-code
/STATUS=’symbol’
/STATUS=’$STATUS’ (default)
Outputs the message corresponding to the specified status code. You can specify
the status code with a decimal or hexadecimal number or a symbol enclosed in
apostrophes. You can omit leading zeros, but you must prefix any hexadecimal
number with “%X”.
If a HELP/MESSAGE command does not include a search string, Help Message
by default outputs the message corresponding to the CLI symbol $STATUS;
that is, Help Message displays information on how the last executed command
completed.
You cannot specify a search string or /FACILITY with /STATUS. /FACILITY is
also illegal if you omit the search string and default to /STATUS=$STATUS’.
/WORD_MATCHGINITIAL_SUBSTRING (default)
/WORD_MATCH=WHOLE_WORD
/WORD_MATCHANITIAL_ SUBSTRING matches all words that begin with a
word specified in the search string. The search string can contain multiple words
to be matched. Only messages that match every word in the search string (in any
order) are output.
/WORD_MATCH=WHOLE_WORD matches whole words only and refines your
search to the exact words specified. For example, an exact search on ACC screens
out dozens of other messages containing words that begin with the letters ACC.
/WORK_FILES=nn
/WORK_FILES=0 (default if qualifier is omitted)
/WORK_FILES=2 (default if qualifier is entered with no value)
Specifies that work files are to be used if the /SORT qualifier is specified. You can
specify a value from 0 to 10 for nn. This qualifier is necessary only for large sort
operations. The qualifier has no effect if /SORT is not specified.
Help Message Utility (MSGHLP) 2-7

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
2.3 Tips for Using the /FACILITY Qualifier
2.3 Tips for Using the /FACILITY Qualifier
When you specify /FACILITY =?, Help Message outputs the names of all facilities
in the database. Unless you specify /SORT, the output alphabetically lists the
facility names for the first .MSGHLP$DATA file in the database, then the second
.MSGHLP$DATA file, and so on.
In addition to the facility names listed in response to /FACILIT=Y? ,
Compaq has included a few internal nicknames to simplify access to
certain facilities. “DCL” is such a nickname. For example, when accessing
MSGHLP$LIBRARY.MSGHLP$DATA, the nickname “DCL” maps to the official
facility name, “CLI, Command Language Interpreter (DCL)”. DCL does not
appear in the list of facility names, but if you enter /FACILITY=DCL ina
command, Help Message outputs CLI messages.
Help Message searches for facility names from the beginning of the facility name's
string only—not on each word of the string as with the message text. Therefore,
you must enter enough characters to narrow your search to the desired field.
For example, a search on /FACILITY=RMS selects messages for two facilities:
« RMS, OpenVMS Record Management Services
« RMSREC, RMS Recovery Utility
To find the RMS messages only, you must enter enough literal characters to make
the search string unique; for example, /FACILITY ='RMS,". The double quotes
are required in order to include the comma (and any following words) in the
search string. Since the double quotes direct Help Message to search for a literal
string, you must specify the precise capitalization used for the facility name in
the database.
2.4 Accessing $STATUS Values for Uninstalled Messages
Any messages that are not installed as part of the OpenVMS operating system
cannot be equated with a value stored in $STATUS until they are recognized
by the system. Such messages include user-supplied messages, third-party
messages, and messages from layered products and certain other OpenVMS
facilities. Your system manager may already have linked all the messages you
need at the system level. If not, you can make these links in your own account.
(System managers who want information about linking message section files at
the system level should refer to the OpenVMS Systen Manager's Manual.)
Before linking such messages, determine whether you must frequently access
them using the value in $STATUS or a value specified using the /STATUS
qualifier. If not, the simplest alternative is to use the HELP/MESSAGE command
and specify the message identifier or message text in the search string.
If you prefer the convenience of having Help Message interpret a $STATUS
value, there are two ways that you can make the system recognize uninstalled
messages:
e The simplest method is to use the SET MESSAGE command to link an
unknown messages .E XE file. For example:
$ SET MESSAGE TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYNEWMSG.EXE
This command includes the messages pointed to by file MYNEWMSG.E XE
as part of the system until you enter another SET MESSAGE command
specifying a different file.
2-8 Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
2.4 Accessing $STATUS Values for Uninstalled Messages
¢ For amore permanent solution, execute the following command for every
message section file that you would like to include in the list of files that Help
Message automatically searches for $STATUS values:
HELP/MESSAGE/SECTION_FILE=file-name.EXE
By default, /SECTION_FILE tries to generate or update object library
SYS$LIBRARY:MSGHLP$MESSAGE_ SECTIONS.OLB. Unless you
have write access to system files, you must first define the logical name
MSGHLP$MESSAGE_SECTIONS to point to your own account.
For example, to make the messages pointed to by file MYNEWMSG.E XE
known in your own account, use this command sequence:
$ DEFINE MSGHLPSMESSAGE_SECTIONS SYSS$LOGIN:MSGHLPSMESSAGE_SECTIONS
$ HELP /MESSAGE/SECTION_FILE=MYNEWMSEGXE
Unlike the SET MESSAGE command, the /SECTION_ FILE qualifier
permanently links the specified message section file unless you later delete it.
The default device and directory for the file specification is SYS$MESSAGE,
where all OpenVMS-supplied message section files are stored, and the default
file type is EXE. Therefore, the following command automatically includes all
OpenVMS-supplied message section files:
$ HELP/MESSAGE/SECTION_FILE=*
Your system manager may already have included the OpenVMS message
section files at the system level. You will need to add these only if you define
the logical name MSGHLP$MESSAGE_ SECTIONS to point to somewhere
other than SYS$LIBRARY:MSGHLP$MESSAGE_ SECTIONS.
Help Message can search a maximum of 42 message section files. Files are
searched in this order:
1. The last file activated by a SET MESSAGE command (if any).
2. The message section files that Help Message is linked with before it is
shipped:
¢ SYSMSG.EXE
¢ SYSMGTMSG.EXE
¢ CLIUTLMSG.EXE
« PRGMSG.EXE
3. Any message section files explicitly linked against MSGHLP$MAIN.EXE or
any of the shareable images that it references.
4. Any non-duplicate message section files linked with a
MSGHLP$MESSAGE _SECTIONS.EXE file, if such a file exists.
The MSGHLP$MESSAGE_SECTIONS.EXE file is automatically generated
from the MSGHLP$MESSAGE_SECTIONS.OLB file each time the
HELP/MESSAGE command is executed with the /SECTION_ FILE qualifier.
Each execution of the /SECTION_ FILE qualifier adds a module to the .OLB
file; each module represents a message section file.
Message section files are searched in the order in which they are listed in the
.OLB file. (Order is alphabetical.) If the total count of message section files
exceeds 42, message section files listed near the end of the .OLB file might
not be searched.
Help Message Utility (MSGHLP) 2-9

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
2.4 Accessing $STATUS Values for Uninstalled Messages
To display the contents of your .OLB file, use this command:
$ LIBRARY/LIST MSGHLPSMESSAGE_SECTIONS.OLB
The names of the modules in this .OLB file are derived from strings specified
in the /SECTION_FILE qualifier.
You can remove references to message section files in the .OLB file in order
to control which 42 message section files Help Message will search. For
example, to delete the NCP (Network Control Program) messages from your
private .OLB file, use this command:
$ LIBRARY/DELETE=NETWRKMSG MSGHLPSMESSAGE_SECTIONS.OLB
If you delete a module from the .OLB file, you must execute the
HELP/MESSAGE command with the /SECTION_FILE qualifier in order
to generate an updated .EXE file. The qualifier argument can specify either a
new file or a file that is already listed in the .OLB file.
2.5 Customizing the Help Message Database
You can create one or more customized Help Message databases by changing
information in the database files (See Section 2.6) and by selecting which files
to include in a database. No matter how you customize your database, you will
typically manipulate two kinds of files:
¢ .MSGHLP$DATA files
One or more .MSGHLP$DATA files form the Help Message database that is
accessed by the HELP/MESSAGE command (see Section 2.2). If you have
write access to the .MSGHLP$DATA files, you can customize the database by
inserting or deleting data contained in .MSGHLLP files. (.MSGHLP files are
described later in this section.)
The system manager can define a system logical name to set up a system-
wide Help Message database that includes all or selected .MSGHLP$DATA
files in a search path. You can also set a logical name in your login file to
include or exclude specific .MSGHLP$DATA files in your personalized Help
Message database (see Section 2.5.2).
¢ .MSGHLLP files
A .MSGHLP file is used as input to change the content of a.MSGHLP$DATA
file. The contents of a .MSGHLP file are applied to a .MSGHLP$DATA
file either as data to be inserted or as data to be deleted from the
-MSGHLP$DATA file. Various options are described in subsections to
Section 2.6.
By setting up different search paths for multiple .MSGHLP$DATA files at the
system or process level, you can create a variety of Help Message databases.
The Help Message qualifier /LIBRARY allows you to access or change a specific
.MSGHLP$DATA file or search path. For more information, see Section 2.5.2.
2.5.1 Creating a .MSGHLP File
There are two ways to create a .MSGHLP file, depending upon the purpose for
which you intend to use the file, as follows:
« Usethe/EXTRACT qualifier with the HELP/MESSAGE command.
Use this method when you want to modify or delete information in the
database.
2-10 Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
2.5 Customizing the Help Message Database
Users with write access to Compag supplied .MSGHLP$DATA files can use a
-.MSGHLP file created in this fashion to add a comment to a Compaq supplied
message or to delete Compaq supplied information from the database. See
the OpenVMS Systen Manager’s Manual for details.
e Write the file from scratch.
Use this technique when you have new messages to add to the database. (See
the .MSGHLLP file format in the example that follows.)
The following example uses the /EXTRACT qualifier to extract hypothetical
message NOSNO from the default database and create a file named
NOSNO.MSGHLP to contain the message description:
$ HELP/MESSAGE/EXTRACT=NOSNO.MSGHLP NOSNO
The .MSGHLP file format uses a unique numerical prefix to designate the
message, facility, explanation, and user action sections of the message description:
1NOSNO, can’t ski; no snow
2XCSKI, XCSKI Program
3Your attempt to ski failed because there is no snow.
4Wait until there is snow and attempt the operation again.
When creating a .MSGHLP file, limit your text to 60 characters per line so that
the Help Message output does not exceed the terminal display area. Also avoid
using a long facility name that wraps to a second line.
Other sections in this chapter explain how you can use the contents of a
-MSGHLP file, edited or unedited, to add data to or delete data from a
-MSGHLP$DATA file.
2.5.2 Defining a Search Path in Your Login File
The Help Message database comprises one or more .MSGHLP$DATA files that
can be accessed individually by the .MSGHLP$DATA file name or collectively
by a search path that includes one or more .MSGHLP$DATA files. The search
path can specify individual .MSGHLP$DATA files or it can specify one or more
directory names. Help Message will search all .MMSGHLP$DATA files in a named
directory.
Your system manager sets up a default Help Message database on the system
or accepts the installation default. When you instruct Help Message to display
messages or to output messages to a file, Help Message defaults to the main
OpenVMS messages file (SYS$HELP:MSGHLP$LIBRARY.MSGHLP$DATA)
unless a search path is defined by logical name MSGHLP$LIBRARY at the
system or user level.
You can create your own .MSGHLP$DATA files to add to the database (see
Section 2.6.1). None of the .MSGHLP$DATA files need be installed on the system
disk. Once you have created the .MSGHLP$DATA files, you can create a logical
name in your login file (SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM) to define a search path
that names the .MSGHLP$DATA files you want to include in your customized
database.
For example, the following command in your login file defines your Help Message
default search path to include the main OpenVMS messages file and another file
called MYMESSAGES.MSGHLP$DATA:
$ DEFINE MSGHLPSLIBRARY SYSSCOMMON: [SYSHLP]MSGHLPSLIBRARY .MSGHLPSDATA, -—
_$ TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA
Help Message Utility (MSGHLP) 2-11

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
2.5 Customizing the Help Message Database
You can set up multiple logical names to create customized search paths that
restrict the Help Message database to minimize search time or that add personal
.MSGHLP$DATA files to the database. For example, the following logical name
omits the main OpenVMS messages file and names two other .MSGHLP$DATA
files instead:
$ DEFINE MSGHLP_ABCDEF TOOLS: [MYPROJ]ABC.TOMOLSS: G[MHYPRLOJP] SDEFD .AMSGTHLAPS,DAT A
If you want Help Message to search all .MSGHLP$DATA files in a directory, you
can define a logical name that points to the directory, but does not name specific
files. You can then add or delete files without changing the logical definition.
For example, the following command defines logical name MSGHLP_MYPRO} to
include all .MSGHLP$DATA files in directory TOOLS:[MYPRO} ]:
$ DEFINE MSGHLP_MYPROJ TOOLS: [MYPROJ]
You can use the /LIBRARY qualifier with the HELP/MESSAGE command to
specify a logical name or a .MSGHLP$DATA file. For example, the following
command specifies that Help Message search only the file DEF. MSGHLP$DATA
for hypothetical message TROUBLE:
$ HELP /MESSAGE/LIBRARY=TOOLS: [MYPROJ]DEF.MSGHLPSDATA TROUBLE
The following command specifies that Help Message search all the files defined
by logical name MSGHLP_ABCDEF (defined in an earlier coding example), which
includes both ABC.MSGHLP$DATA and DEF.MSGHLP$DATA:
$ HELP /MESSAGE/LIBRARY=MSGHLP_ABCDEF TROUBLE
If you have defined no search paths in your account, the following command
directs Help Message to search the default database defined at the system level:
$ HELP/MESSAGE TROUBLE
Typically Help Message searches all .MSGHLP$DATA files in a search path.
However, on /INSERT and /DELETE operations, Help Message operates on only
one .MSGHLP$DATA file: either a file specified with the /LIBRARY qualifier, a
default .MSGHLP$DATA file, or the first MMSGHLP$DATA file in a default or
specified search path.
Unless you have write access to the Compaq supplied .MSGHLP$DATA files, it
makes sense to put the .MSGHLP$DATA file that you are most likely to update
first in a search string. For example, if you have the first of the following two
commands in your login file, the second command would by default update file
MY MESSAGES.MSGHLP$DATA:
$ DEFINE MSGHLPSLIBRARY TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA, -
_$ SYSSCOMMON: [SYSHLP]MSGHLPSLIBRARY.MSGHLPSDATA
$ HELP /MESSAGE/INSERT=NEW_MESS.AMSGGEHSLP
An alternative is to use the /LIBRARY qualifier to override the default
.MSGHLP$DATA file and specify the file that you want to update. For example:
$ DEFINE MSGHLPSLIBRARY SYSSCOMMON: [SYSHLP]MSGHLPSLIBRARY .MSGHLPSDATA, -
_$ TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA
$ HELP /MESSAGE/INSERT=NEW_MES.SMASGGHELSP-
_$ /LIBRARY=TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA

2.6 Modifying the Help Message Database
2.6 Modifying the Help Message Database
You can modify the database by adding or deleting information. When you add
information to the database, user-supplied documentation displays with a change
bar in the left margin to distinguish it from Compaq supplied data.
Only users with write access to Compaq supplied .MSGHLP$DATA files
can delete Compaq supplied data or update these files (see the O0eVMS
Systen Manager’s Manual for details). However, any user can create a
private .MSGHLP$DATA file and include it in the Help Message database
(see Section 2.5.2).
The following sections explain how to make these modifications:
« Add messages to the database (See Section 2.6.1).
¢ Delete user-supplied messages from the database (see Section 2.6.2).
¢« Change user-supplied information in the database (see Section 2.6.3).
« Change Compaq supplied messages documentation (see Section 2.6.4).
2.6.1 Adding Messages to the Database
You can add new messages to the database by creating a .MSGHLP$DATA file
and adding it to a Help Message database search path. The .MSGHLP$DATA file
that you create remains intact throughout system upgrades.
Follow these steps to add new messages to the Help Message database:
1. Create a .MSGHLP file with all your message descriptions in it. (The
formatted data in the .MSGHLP file is used as input to create the
-MSGHLP$DATA file.) (See Section 2.5.1 for an example of the .MSGHLP file
format.)
2. Usethe .MSGHLP file to create a .MSGHLP$DATA file. Use the /LIBRARY
qualifier to specify the name of the .MSGHLP$DATA file that you want to
create:
$ HELP /MESSAGE/INSERT=MYMESSAGES .MSGHLP-
_§ /LIBRARY=TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA
3. Add the new .MSGHLP$DATA file to a Help Message database search path,
as described in Section 2.5.2.
2.6.2 Deleting Messages from the Database
You can delete any message, provided you have write access to the
-MSGHLP$DATA file that contains the message. User-supplied data displays
with change bars in the left margin to distinguish it from Compaq supplied data.
Compaq supplied messages can be deleted only by users with write access to
Compaq supplied .MSGHLP$DATA files, usually the system manager. (See the
OpenVMS Systen Manager’s Manual for details.)
Use a .MSGHLP file to delete messages, as follows:
1. Extract the message that you want to delete into a .MSGHLP file. The
following example extracts hypothetical message PROBLEM from the default
database:
$ HELP/MESSAGE/EXTRACT=PROBLEM.MSGHLP PROBLEM
Help Message Utility (MSGHLP) 2-13

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
2.6 Modifying the Help Message Database
2. Check the contents of PROBLEM.MSGHLFP to see if the Help Message search
picked up any other messages that you were not expecting. If necessary,
edit the file to include only the messages that you want to delete from the
database.
3. Usethe/DELETE qualifier to delete the messages in PROBLEM.MSGHLP
from the .MSGHLP$DATA file:
$ HELP /MESSAGE/DELETE=PROBLEM.MSGHLP
Remember that a delete operation acts on only the first .MSGHLP$DATA file
in a search path. If necessary, you can use the /LIBRARY qualifier to specify
a particular .MSGHLP$DATA file. See Section 2.5.2 for more information
about default databases and search paths.
If you keep the PROBLEM.MSGHLLP file, you can later use this file with
the /INSERT qualifier to put the deleted messages back into the database,
possibly in a different .MSGHLP$DATA file.
4. When you delete messages from the database, free space is created
in the library. The following command sequence compresses file
MY MESSAGES.MSGHLP$DATA to use as little disk space as possible:
$ CONVERT TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA -
_$ TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA
$ PURGE TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA
2.6.3 Changing User-Supplied Data
You can change any user-supplied data, provided you have write access to the
.MSGHLP$DATA file. User-supplied data displays with change bars in the left
margin to distinguish it from Compaq supplied data.
Compaq supplied documentation can be modified only by users with write access
to Compaq supplied .MSGHLP$DATA files, usually the system manager. (See the
OpenVMS System Manager’s Manual for details.) Other users can make a copy of
a Compaq supplied message and edit that to fit their needs (see Section 2.6.4).
The procedure for updating an existing message is slightly different depending on
which field you want to change. Both procedures are described in the following
sections.
Changing the Explanation or User Action Fields
Follow these steps to change the explanation or user action fields:
1. Extract the message that you want to edit into a .MSGHLP file
The following example extracts hypothetical message FIXIT from
MY MESSAGES.MSGHLP$DATA:
$ HELP/MESSAGE/EXTRACT=FIXIT.MSGHLP-
_$ /LIBRARY=TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES.MSGHLPSDATA FIXIT
Edit the explanation or user action fields in Fl XIT.MSGHLP.
3. Update MYMESSAGES.MSGHLP$DATA using the edited FI XIT.MSGHLP
file as input. For example:
$ HELP/MESSAGE/INSERT=FIXIT.MSGHLP-
_$ /LIBRARY=TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA
2-14 Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)

2.6 Modifying the Help Message Database
Changing the Message Text or Facility Fields
Help Message updates an existing message entry by comparing the message text
and facility name fields for an identical match before changing any data in the
explanation or user action fields. Therefore, if you want to change the message
text of an existing message, you must delete the current message before you
insert the revised message. Otherwise, both the old and the new message will
appear in the database.
1. Extract the message that you want to edit into a .MSGHLP file. The following
example extracts hypothetical message PROBLEM from the default database:
$ HELP/MESSAGE/EXTRACT=PROBLEM.MSGHLP PROBLEM
2. Check the contents of PROBLEM.MSGHLP to see if the Help Message search
picked up any other messages that you were not expecting. If necessary,
edit the file to include only the messages that you want to delete from the
database.
3. Usethe /DELETE qualifier to delete the messages in PROBLEM.MSGHLP
from the .MSGHLP$DATA file:
$ HELP /MESSAGE/DELETE=PROBLEM.MSGHLP
See Section 2.6.2 for full details about deleting messages from the database.
4. Edit the message text or facility name in the .MSGHLP file.
Update the database using the edited .MSGHLP file as input. For example:
$ HELP /MESSAGE/INSERT=PROBLEM.MSGHLP
This command updates the default .MSGHLP$DATA file. Section 2.5.2
describes how the default database for an insert operation can differ from the
default database for an output operation.
2.6.4 Changing Compaq Supplied Messages Documentation
If you have write access to Compaq supplied .MSGHLP$DATA files, refer to the
OpenVMS Systen Manager's Manual for information about modifying or deleting
Compaq supplied messages documentation.
If you do not have write access to Compaq supplied .MSGHLP$DATA files, there
are two ways you can add comments to or modify a Compaq supplied message:
¢ Ask a user with write access to the files, usually the system manager, to add
your comment to the database. This is the best solution if your comment
would be helpful to other users on the system.
Please report to Compaq any errors in a message text string so that we can
correct the problem in future databases.
* Create a copy of the Compaq message in your own .MSGHLP$DATA file and
edit the description to suit your needs. Follow these steps:
1. Extract the Compaq supplied message that you want to edit. The
following example extracts the message BAD_NEWS from a default
database that includes this hypothetical Compaq supplied message:
$ HELP /MESSAGE/EXTRACT=BAD_NEWS.MSGHLP BAD_NEWS
2. Edit any fields in BAD NEWS.MSGHLP to say whatever you want.
Help Message Utility (MSGHLP) 2-15

Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)
2.6 Modifying the Help Message Database
3. Update your own .MSGHLP$DATA file using the edited BAD __
NEWS.MSGHLP file as input. For example:
$ HELP/MESSAGE/INSERT=BAD_NEWS .MSGHLP/LIBRARY=TOOLS: [MYPROJ]-
_$ MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA
If your .MSGHLP$DATA file is included in a search path of the main database,
a Help Message search will output both the Compaq supplied message and your
version of the message. Your version is distinguished by change bars in the left
margin.

Message Descriptions
Starting memory dump...
Facility: BUGCHECK, System Bugcheck
Explanation: The OpenVMS operating system reached an irrecoverable or
inconsistent situation and is beginning a bugcheck sequence. If the system
is configured to write a memory dump, messages similar to the following
messages might accompany the dump:
Header and error log buffers dumped...
SPT & GPT dumped...
System space (SO) dumped...
Global pages dumped...
‘ process-name’ dumped...
‘ process-name’ dumped...
#4 Memory dump complete...
These messages give information about the progress of the writing of that
dump. These messages appear if the SYSGEN parameter DUMPSTYLE is
set so that a selective dump (that is, a dump of selected portions of system
space and process address space in virtual memory) is written.
A selective dump is similar to a complete dump when writing the dump
header and system error log buffers. Following these items, it differs from
the complete dump by immediately writing out the system and global page
tables. The page tables and system space are the minimum content needed
to analyze a crash dump; configuring your dump file so that this minimum
cannot be dumped causes the dump to be useless.
The global pages written during the dump are written separately from the
processes that might reference them. This allows a single copy of each global
page to exist in the dump. Processes are selected to have their PO and P1
spaces dumped in the following order: current processes (if any) on the CPU
that initiated the bugcheck, special system processes, current processes (if
any) on other CPUs, and any other processes. A message giving the name of
the process follows the writing of the dump for that process if it completed
successfully .
Global and process pages are optional when writing a dump because the
dump may still yield useful information if they are not present. However,
Compaq recommends that you use a dump file at least as large as the one
created by AUTOGEN. If the dump file is not large enough to hold all process
and page files, the dump is still considered to have finished normally.
User Action: None. However, if you wish, save a copy of the dump file and
contact a Compaq support representative.

Facility: MOUNT, Mount Utility
Explanation: The specified volume does not match the volume in the drive.
User Action: |f the specified volume name was incorrect, enter Ctrl/Y to
cancel the mount; then retry the operation using the correct label. If the
wrong volume is mounted on the drive, the operator must mount the correct
volume on the drive or mount the volume on another drive and redirect the
mount using this command:
REPLY/TO=identification-number "SUBSTITUTE device-name"
WRONGVOL, ‘save-set-spec’ is not the next volume in the set
Facility: BACKUP, Backup Utility
Explanation: The volume mounted as a continuation volume of a
multivolume save set is not the successor of the previous volume of the
save set. Volumes must be processed in the order of their creation.
User Action: Locate and mount the correct continuation volume.
MSG-170

Message Descriptions
WRONGVU, device is already a member of another virtual unit
Facility: MOUNT, Mount Utility
Explanation: This message can occur under any of the following conditions:
e« A shadow set member (identified in an accompanying SHADOWFAIL
message) is already mounted on another node in the cluster as a member
of a different shadow set.
e« The device is the target of a shadow set copy operation, and the copy
operation has not yet started. In this case, the storage control block
(SCB) of the copy target is not in the same location as it is on the master
node. This causes MOUNT to read the wrong SCB and fail with this
error.
e The target of the shadow set copy operation is a new, uninitialized disk.
This failure is commonly seen when a MOUNT/CLUSTER command
is issued and one or more of the members is a new disk. The set is
mounted successfully on the local node, but all of the remote nodes report
a WRONGVU error.
User Action:
¢ For the first condition, specify a different member for the shadow set you
are mounting, or specify the correct virtual unit for the member that is
already mounted elsewhere.
¢ For the second condition, wait for the copy operation to proceed before
attempting to remount this device, or initialize the copy target disk so
that the SCB is in the same location as it is on the master member.
¢ For the third condition, OpenVMS recommends that all new disks be
initialized prior to mounting them into a shadow set.
