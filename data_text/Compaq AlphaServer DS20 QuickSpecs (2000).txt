SCSI shelf with DS-BA356-xx shelf when adding an UltraSCSI disk and
when connecting to UltraSCSI adapter.

UltraSCSI shelf; UltraSCSI adapter negotiates maximum transfer speed
of drives.

1. Installing one BA370 and one system in an H9A10 or H9A15 cabinet requires
mandatory selection of a ballast kit; ballast kit not required if two BA370s and one
system are installed in an H9A10 or H9A15 cabinet.
2. Maximum operating temperature at sea level; reduce by 1.8(cid:176) F (1(cid:176) C) for each 2,000
ft (600m) above sea level.
3. Higher altitudes are possible if maximum operating temperature is reduced (see
Temperature); other restrictions may apply such as maximum permissible altitude for
hard drives.
