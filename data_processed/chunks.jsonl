The area they occupy is the icon bar. Icons are described in the\nnext section.\nThe pointer The arrow on the screen is the pointer. It is used to indicate items you want to use or\nmove.\nThe pointer moves around the screen as you move the mouse. The mouse moves best\nover a firm, flat surface. Try moving the mouse to see how the pointer moves.\nAs soon as the desktop has appeared on the screen, you can begin working. It is\nbetter, though, to read the next section, which explains briefly the principles of the\nArchimedes desktop and its components.\nGetting started 12\n\nThe Archimedes desktop\nThis section describes the appearance of the desktop, the principles of the window system and how to use the\ndesktop features.\nThe desktop When you first switch on the computer, the desktop is normally displayed on the\nscreen. This is your working area. At first it is clear, except for the icon bar. As you\nperform tasks and use applications, items will be added to the desktop. You can move\nthem around the desktop as you wish, change their size, hide and remove them to\nmake room for others.\nThe Archimedes desktop and windows system is easy to use because you don't have to\nremember long, complicated commands.

In a window you can\nshow a list of the files on a disc, write a memo or a program, draw a picture, alter the\ncolours used for the screen display or perform other types of task. You can have\nseveral windows open on the screen at once, and you can even be doing something\ndifferent in each of them at the same time. Windows are described further in the\nsection Using windows.\nIcons The icons which appear on the icon bar represent things available for use on the desktop. If you want to do\nsomething, or examine the contents of a filing system, you look at the icon bar to see\nif its icon is available. If it is, you can select it and a window containing the activity\nyou want is opened.\nThe Archimedes desktop 14\n\nThe icons on the left of the icon bar represent the information storage facilities - that\nis, the discs and other places where you can load information from, and save it to. At\nleast one will appear on the icon bar:\nFloppy disc drive. The Archimedes computer uses 3.5 inch floppy discs, loaded into\nthe drive slot on the front panel. You can save (store) information by copying it from\nthe computer's memory onto a floppy disc, and retrieve it later by loading it back into\nthe computer from the disc. Floppy discs are described in the chapter Disc drives.\nThere may also be:\nHard disc. If you have a hard disc, 'a hard disc icon will also appear in the lower left\nhand corner.\nEconet. If your computer is fitted with a card for an Econet local area network,\nthere will also be an Econet icon.\nOn the right hand side are the applications icons. These represent things you can do,\nsuch as word-processing and drawing programs. Initially only two are 'loaded:\nPalette.

The buttons on the mouse are used to\nselect or adjust items you are pointing at on the screen, or to display menus. Using the\nmouse is explained in the next chapter.\nMenus A menu is a list of tasks or other options from which you can choose what you want to\ndo next. Menus are an easy way of making a selection - you don't usually have to type\nanything, you just point at what you want, then select it. See the chapter Menus for\nmore details.\nThe Archimedes desktop 16\n\nUsing the mouse\nThis chapter tells you how to hold and move the mouse, and how to carry out the different mouse techniques\nused in the desktop. If you have any difficulties making it work, turn to the chapter \"If things go wrong\".\nThe mouse is used to select, move and adjust items displayed on the screen. It is your\nprincipal means of communicating with the Archimedes desktop.\nAs you move the mouse, the pointer on the screen moves correspondingly. Try it and\nsee:\nHolding the mouse Hold the mouse with the cable away from you so that your fingers rest easily on the\nthree buttons. If you are right-handed, you should hold it like this:\nMove the mouse around and watch the pointer move around the screen. If you run out\nof space to move the mouse, lift it up and put it down again in a more convenient\nspot. While the mouse is lifted, the pointer will not move, and when you put it down\nagain you can carry on where you left off.\nUsing the mouse 17\n\nThe select button is used most of the time to select icons displayed on the screen.\nPressing the menu button usually makes a menu appear.

This is\ncalled clicking.\nTwo other mouse techniques are also used:\ndouble-clicking - pressing and releasing twice in quick succession. This is used to\ninitiate an action, or to load an application, for example.\ndragging - to move an icon from one place to another.\nClicking and dragging techniques are summarised on the next page.\nUsing the mouse 18\n\nClicking\n1.

The bar will snap to the position of the pointer, and the colour\nwill change accordingly. Keep the button down, and drag the bar backwards\nand forwards. Notice how the colour at the top of the window changes as you\ndo this - it works rather like a slider volume control on a stereo. By moving\nthe bar, you're adjusting the proportions of green in the colour of the title bar.\nTry dragging the other bars, too, to see how different proportions of blue and\nred change the colour of the title bar.\nWhen you have practised this a bit, click on the cross in the top left of the\nwindow. The palette disappears, but the new colour definitions are still used\nuntil you change the colours again or switch off the computer.\nThat's clicking and dragging. If you want to know more about the colour\npalette itself, see the User Guide.\nUsing the mouse 21\n\nUsing the mouse 22\n\nDisc drives\nThis chapter tells you how to use and take care of your Archimedes discs and drives.\nFloppy discs and hard Information and programs are stored on discs. There are two types of disc\ndiscs floppy discs and hard discs.\nThe Archimedes personal workstation uses 3.5-inch floppy discs, which are loaded\ninto the computer as they are needed.\nA hard disc is much faster and holds a lot more information than a floppy disc, and is\nbuilt into the computer. If your Archimedes model has a hard disc, its presence is\nindicated by an amber light labelled H/DISC on the front panel of the computer.\nDisc drives 23\n\nInserting floppy discs The floppy disc drive is the slot to the right of the computer unit. Insert discs\nlike this, with the label uppermost:\nThe disc clicks into place when it is fully inserted.

The chapter The\nAdvanced Disc Filing System in the User Guide tells you how to make\nback-ups.\nArchimedes machines with hard discs are delivered with the Applications\nsuite on the hard disc.\nAccessing information To gain access to the information contained on a floppy disc which has been\non discs inserted into the drive, or on a hard disc, click on the appropriate disc drive\nicon on the icon bar:\nDisc drives 24\n\nThe contents of the disc will be displayed in a window for you to see:.\nWrite-protecting floppy The Applications discs are supplied write-protected. This means that you cannot\ndiscs change anything on the disc, delete anything by mistake, or save any new files to the\ndisc.\nYou write-protect a new disc by moving the plastic tab with your finger nail towards\nthe outside edge of the disc:\nDisc drives 25\n\nLooking after floppy You will build up a collection of discs as time passes. Label them so that you\ndiscs always know which one holds the information you need. Store them carefully\nand keep them away from:\n• extremes of temperature\n• strong magnetic fields\n• dust, dirt, coffee, pets etc.\nDon't open the metal shutter on the disc, as the disc surface is easily\ncontaminated by dust.\nLooking after hard discs If your Archimedes computer is fitted with a hard disc, you'll have less\nfloppy discs to worry about, but you should take some additional precautions, as\nfollows:\n• Never move the computer, or press Break or Reset, whilst the H/DISC\nactivity light is illuminated.\n• If you have a 20MB hard disc, when you have finished your session, and\nbefore you switch off, click on Dismount on the hard di", "start_char": 21450, "end_char": 23650}

It describes\nhow to move through the contents of a document too large to display in a window all at once.\nWhat is a window? A window is an area of the screen displaying an activity or application. Examples of\nwindows you have seen so far are the colour selection palette and the directory window,\ndisplayed when you click on the palette and disc drive icons respectively.\nFeatures of windows Most windows can be moved around the screen, hidden behind other windows, or closed\ncompletely. Icons on the windows allow you to do these things. Some windows also\nhave icons which allow you to change their size.\nWindows 27\n\nTitle bar Displays the title of the window. This may be the name of an application, or the name\nof a document if you are editing text.\nBack icon If you click on this, the window will be hidden behind any windows which overlap the\narea it occupies. The effect is that of putting the window to the back of the 'pile' of\nwindows on the screen.\nClose icon Clicking on the Close icon closes the window, removing it from the screen.\nToggle size icon This icon switches the window between full size and the last size displayed. (Full size\nis either large enough to display the complete document, or so that the window fills the\nscreen.

Many\ndifferent extensions may be added to the basic ATOM including further\nmemory for user programs or high resolution graphics, an interEace to\na printer, and the extension ROM which provides floating-point\narithmetic and the COLOUR statement. This technical manual contains\nthe information needed in order to construct the ATOM kit and add any\nof the extensions. Use of the ATOM is described in the book 'Atomic\nTheory and Practice' and users with assembled and tested ATOMs may not\nneed to refer to this manual.\nWhen purchased directly from Acorn Computers Ltd the assembled and\ntested ATOM is guaranteed for a full six months if used correctly. The\ncomponenent parts of kits are also guaranteed for six months and a fast\nservice facility for assembled kits is available at Cambridge. In\ngeneral repairs at Cambridge are carried out within two weeks and they\nare invoiced at around ten pounds plus the cost of any replacement\ncomponents for ATOMs over six months old.\n\nThe ATOM is compatible with the Acorn series Eurocards for the\n6502 micro-processor and it can be extended by adding one card inside\nthe ATOM case, or any number of cards in an external card frame.\nConnection to the cards is by a standard Acorn bus connector, and this\nis described in this manual.

The ATOM can therefore be used to develop\nprograms for later use on larger computer systems, for data\nacquisition and control purposes, and as a personal computer.\nOne significant aspect of the ATOM is its capacity for expansion,\nfirst by adding further components to the circuit board and then by\nadding extra boards within the case. One extension allows connection\nof the ATOM to the Acorn ring whereby a number of computers can\ncommunicate and share peripheral devices such as disk drives,\nplatters, and printers. In this manual the addition of the standard\nextensions is described.\n3\nCONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE\nBEFORE YOU START\nCarefully unpack the ATOM kit and check that all the component parts\nare present. ard that none are damaged. In case of supply difficulties\nsubstitute components may be supplied; for instance 100nF capacitors\nmay replace 47nF parts.\nFor capacitors note that values may be expressed in two ways:\nO.1uF = 100nF\n10nF = 10000pF\n1nF = 1000pF\nO.1nF = 100pF etc.\nCapacitors supplied with Acorn products are usually identified by\na three digit number, the first two digits being the first two digits\nof the value followed by a third digit giving the number of zeros. For\nexample:\n101 is 10 and one zero which is 100pF.\n103 is 10 and three zeros which is 10000pF or 10nF.\n473 is 47 and three zeros which is 47nF or 0.047uF.\nResistors are identified by coloured bands of which three at one\nend give the value with a fourth giving the components tolerance:\nThe first and second bands give the first two digits of the value with\nthe third indicating the number of following zeros:\nBlack is 0\nBrown is 1\nRed is 2\nOrange is 3\nYellow is 4\nGreen is 5\nBlue is 6\nViolet is 7\n\nGrey is 8\nWhite is 9\nFor example consider a resistor with the coloured bands Yellow,\nViolet, Orange, space, Silver. This is 47 followed by three zeros,\nthat is 47000 or 47K ohms. When writing the value of a resistor note\nthat 4.7 Kohms is usually written 4K7, and 270 ohms as 270R. The\nfourth band identifies the t", "start_char": 1950, "end_char": 4150}

This is 47 followed by three zeros,\nthat is 47000 or 47K ohms. When writing the value of a resistor note\nthat 4.7 Kohms is usually written 4K7, and 270 ohms as 270R. The\nfourth band identifies the tolerance as follows:\n4\nRed is +or-2%\nGold is +or-5%\nSilver is +or-10%\nAny of these may be used with the ATOM.\nSOLDERING TECHNIQUE\nAssembling the ATOM will require a considerable amount of soldering\nand a small electric soldering iron is essential. The iron should be\nrated between 10 and 30 Watts with a diameter at the end of the bit\nnot exceeding 0.1 inches. Fine 22-gauge flux cored solder should be\nused. People with no previous experience of this type of work should\nnot attempt the ATOM assembly without assistance. When soldering make\nsure that the component is well pushed on to the board as shown, use a\nminimum of solder, and once the solder has run remove the iron.\nSome of the integrated circuits used in the ATOM employ M.O.S.\ntechnology and they can be damaged by static electricity. As a general\nrule if there is no noticeable static charge in the area and no nylon\nclothes or carpets are present all will be well. An earthed soldering\niron should be used when working on a board carrying M.O.S. circuits.\nThe ATOM printed circuit board is double sided, through-hole\nplated glass fibre. A layer of green solder resist ensures that\naccidental solder splashes do not short out tracks and a white\ncomponent legend clearly in8icates where each part goes.\nExamine the board for faults or damage before commencing work. Do\nnot solder through holes on the board connecting tracks from one side\nto the other without a component in them as they may be damaged; in\nany case these holes should have solder resist over them.\n5\nPARTS LIST\nParts supplied with the basic ATOM kit are as follow\nIC6 74LS138 TTL Decoder.\nIC7 74LS02 TTL NOR Gate.\n\nIC8 74LS00 TTL NAND Gate.\nIC9 74LS04 TTL Inverter\nIC20 MM52164 Read Only Memory.\nIC22 6502-1MHz.

Carefully remove the key assembly from its protective\nbacking and lay it key-top side down with the leads sticking upwards.\nCheck that all of the leads are straight and correct any that are bent\nover. Taking great care not to bend any of the leads position the\ncircuit board over the key assembly such that the keys will be on side\n10\n\n1 of the board, that is the side opposite to the ICs and passives etc .\nLower the circuit board over the key leads so that they poke through\nthe holes in the circuit board and then move the two parts until the\nfixing screw holes are aligned. Ensure that ALL of the key leads poke\nthrough the circuit board. Then fix the keyboard to the PCB using six\nself-tappinq screws with insulating washers to ensure that they do not\nshort out the PCB tracks. Solder each key lead on to the side of the\nlarge plated through-holes in the circuit board pushing the leads over\nto the side of the hole where necessary. Do NOT fill the holes with\nsolder; when the solder cools it may contract and break the\nplated-through connection. L3o not allow blobs of solder to fall\nthrough the holes into the keys.\nCONNECTORS\nThe power jack socket and the D.I.N. socket for the tape recorder are\nmounted on side 2 of the board and soldered on side 1. The power\nsocket, SK3, has two lugs which are soldered into the board and the\nthird connection is made with a short piece of wire, such as an offcut\nfrom a resistor. SK2 is a 7 pin socket which is held by a spring clip\nthrough two holes near the front of the board and by the seven\nsoldered leads.\nPlugs PL4, PL5, PL6, PL7, and PL8 are not required on the minimum\nconfiguration ATOM.\nLOUDSPEAKER\nFix the loudspeaker to side 1 of the board to the right of the\nkeyboard using a dou", "start_char": 9750, "end_char": 11950}

These are indicated on the fallowing diagram.\nThe normal ATOM produces a monochrome picture, even if a colour\ntelevision or monitor is used. The PAL encoder circuit board can be\nfitted inside the case to give a colour picture.\nPOWER SUPPLY\nThe basic ATOM requires a power source of 8 volts DC which is\nregulated on the circuit board by IC53 and IC54 to produce a\nstabilised 5 volts. The ATOM high-efficiency mains adaptor provides\nsuch a source, and it is fitted with a jack plug for connecting to the\nATOM. The high-efficiency mains adapter is capable of delivering up to\n1600 mA and powering a fully-expanded ATOM using the low-power mennry\nthat is currently supplied. This current is obtained as follows:\nMinimal system 2K RAM 750 mA\n10K expansion memory at 75 mA per K 750 mA\nBus buffers and 6522 VIA 100 mA\nNote that ATONs supplied before October 1980 used normal-power RAM\nmemory devices which have a current consumption of 100 mA per K; the\ntotal current consumption of a fully-expanded ATOw usinq normal-power\nmemory is therefore too great for the ATOM mains adapter.\nREGULATED SUPPLY\nThe ATOM may alternatively be powered by a 5v regulated supply. In\nthis case two links, LK6 and LK7, should be fitted to the board. The\npower distribution on the board is normally separated into two\nsections; one for each regulator. These sections should be joined\ntogether by fitting a link at LK6 on the circuit board. The regulators\nshould be bypassed by fitting link LK7 on the board. The power socket,\nSK3, is now for a stabilised 5 volt input and the mains adaptor must\nNOT be plugged into it. This fa=t should be rarked clearly on a label\nattached near the power socket on the back of the ATOM.\n\nA circuit far providing a stabilised 5 volts at up to 3000 mA\n13\ncapable of powering a fully expanded ATOM together with any Acorn\neurocard is give", "start_char": 15600, "end_char": 17800}

Both monitors and televisions may now require\nadjustment of the vertical hold control. After further fine tuning in\nthe case of the television to obtain a sharp display, the brilliance\ncontrol should be set so that the background is slightly grey rather\nthan black. The contrast control is then adjusted to make the\ncharacters as bright as reiquired.\nIf no display is found check that all the connections are correct\nand in the case of ATOMs assembled from kits check that the\nconstruction procedure has been followed correctly. when the display\non the screen is correct refer to the book 'Atomic Theory and\nPractice' for details of how to program the ATOM.\nTAPE RECORDER\nPrograms or data may be stored on standard audio tape using a domestic\ntape or cassette recorder. The ATOM contains a Computer Users Tape\nStandard (CUTS) interface, and connection to the recorder is by a 3\npin D.I.N. plug in SK2. Pin 1 is the output to the recorder, pin 2 is\nthe 0 volt or common connection, and pin 3 is the input to the ATOM\n\n14\nfrom the recorder. These are shown in the diagrarr:\nOnly a 3 pin lead should be used as the other 4 pins of SK2 carry\ndigital outputs which may damage recorders with 5 or 7 pin connectors.\nBoth recording and playback on the ATOM are crystal controlled\nand, except on very cheap recorders whose speed may vary, no trcuble\nshould be experienced when transferring tapes from one ATOM to\nanother.

Should correct\nresults not be obtained the signal levels may require adjustment. Both\nthe input and output are normally set to a level of 300 mV R.M.S. The\noutput can be adjusted by changinq the value of R29 so that the\nrecorder's VU meter reads 70% on recording (20% = -3dB). The gain of\nthe input amplifier on the ATOM may be changed by altering R34; hi-fi\ncassette decks are generally more sensitive and often require that\nthis resistor is changed from 47K to 220K.\nOUTPUT PORTS\nPins 4,5,6 and 7 of SK2 carry bits 1,2,0 and 3 respectively of part C\nof the INS8255 (address B002). These are normally set to output mode\nand they will drive a standard TTL load. Bits 0 and 1 also drive the\ntape interface, bit 2 bleeps the loudspeaker, and bit 3 selects\nbetween the two possible sets of four colours. Refer to the book\n'Atomic Theory and Practice' for further details.\n15\nCIRCUIT DESCRIPTION\nThe block diagram of the ATOM shows the essential elements of a\nmicro-computer system. The 6502 micro-processor is provided with a 1\nNHz clock with which all action on its bus is synchronised. The bus\nhas 8 data connections which allow data to be transferred from the\nprocessor to other devices or vice-versa. 16 address lines select the\nlocation to which or from which data is transferred; the most\nsignificant lines feed the chip select logic which selects the device\nbeing accessed whilst the rest of the lines select the location within\nthe device.\nThe reset signal at break or power up causes the processor to\nfetch instructions down the data bus from the Operating System/BASIC\nROM (Read Only Memory). Executing these instructions sets up the\nscreen and scans the keys, and when BASIC statements are entered more\ninstructions in the ROM interpret the statements and communicate with\nthe screen, tape interface etc. using routines in the O.S.", "start_char": 19500, "end_char": 21700}

Executing these instructions sets up the\nscreen and scans the keys, and when BASIC statements are entered more\ninstructions in the ROM interpret the statements and communicate with\nthe screen, tape interface etc. using routines in the O.S. section of\n\nthe ROM.\nThe block zero RAM (Random Access Memory), from 40000 to 00400, is\nused by the processor for scratch pad and stack menory. This RAM\nshould not normally be accessed by the user.\nThe user RAM, that is the space in which lines of BASIC text are\nstored, can be the lower text space or, as in the unexpanded ATOM, the\nupper text space or graphics space may be used.\nA Video Display Generator (VDG) produces synchronisation signals\nfor the television or monitor picture scan in time with a series of\nrefresh addresses which fetch data for the screen from the video RAM.\nThe screen is \"memory mapped\"; each dot on the screen shows the\ninformation in a corresponding piece of memory. Normally only the VDG\naccesses the video RAM obtaining information with which to refresh the\nscreen. When the information on the screen is to be changed the\ntri-state buffers are enabled allowing the processor to write new data\ninto the RAM. The VDG is fed with a 3.58 NHz frequency from which the\nsync and refresh timing is derived. Both monochrome and colour\ninformation are prado'.\"ed by ihe VDG.\nIn the most basic ATOM the 1024 by 8 (that is 1 Kbyte) video RAN\nis divided into two sections. Half of the RAN is used for video so\nthat a screen full of normal characters can be stored and the rest is\nused for the upper text space. Extended ATONs will normally have RAM\nin the lower text space position and so the original video RAM\ntogether with the extension video RAM is used to provide the higer\nresolution graphics modes.\nAnother device on the bus is a peripheral interface which provides\n24 input and output signal lines. Some of these lines are used to\ncontrol the VDG and one in particular is a signal from the VDG\nindicating the vertical blanking period of the screen. During this\nperiod the processor can enable the tri-state buffers and access the\nvideo RAN without producing interference on the screen. This signal\nalso provides the timinq", "start_char": 21450, "end_char": 23650}

This signal\nalso provides the timinq for the WAIT statement.\nThe INS8255 PIA interfaces with the ATOM keyboard in which the\nkeys are arranged in a matrix. A 4 to 10 line decoder-driver is driven\nby the peripheral interface and its 10 outputs drive each row of the\nkey matrix in turn. The peripheral interface is used to read the\noutputs from the columns of the key matrix as each input is driven and\nso the matrix position of any depressed key is determined.\nA Computer Users Tape Standard interface is also connected via the\nperipheral interface. This standard saves data or programs on tape as\na sequence of two different tones . A logical 1 signal is represented\nby a frequency of 2.4 KHz whilst logical 0 is a 1.2 KHz frequency.\nEach bit, that is 0 or 1, lasts for 3.3 mS giving an operating speed\nof 300 bits per second. The 2.4 KHz standard is derived from the 4 MHz\n16\ncrystal with a frequency divider chain and it is fed to the peripheral\ninterface and the tape output. The input from the tape recorder passes\nthrough an amplifier and a schmidt trigger before being fed into\nperipheral interface. Another line from the peripheral interface is\nused to drive the loudspeaker.\nTwo more ROMs may be fitted in the ATOM. One contains instructios\nis for interpreting additional BASIC statements which deal with floating\npoint numbers, scientific functions and colour graphics. The other ROM\ncan provide extra utilities, such as programs to deal with serial\ninterfaces to the ATOM, abaci the comunications ring\nAn optional Versatile Interface Adaptor (VIA) may be fitted giving\ninput or output lines allowing the ATOM to interface to external\nhardware. Also a driver device can be added allowing the VIA to\n\nconnect to parallel printers of the Centronics type.\nFinally a set of bus buffers may be added allowing the ATOM bus to\nconnect to external devices such as extension RAM floppy disc drives\netc.\n17\n\n18 19\nATOM MEMORY MAP\nFFFF Top of memory X\nX\nX\nF000 ROM MM52164 IC20 X\nE000 Reser", "start_char": 23400, "end_char": 25600}

Unnlug the ATOM power connector before taking the case apart.\nUnder the case two screws are undone to remove the case bottom\nallowing access to the component side 2 of the circuit board. When it\nis necessary to solder in extra ’.C. sockets the board is removed from\nthe top of the case by undoing the screws at each corner of the board.\nThe case is assembled as described in the Construction Procedure.\nLOWER TEXT SPACE EXTENSION\nThe first extension usually required is more RAM for BASIC text space.\nThe unexpanded ATOM has 1024 bytes (1Kbyte) of RAM provided by ICs 42\nand 43 of which 512 bytes is the upper text space and 512 bytes is the\nvideo RAM. Every time the ATOM is powered up or reset it automatically\nchecks to see if there is RAM in the lower text space and uses it for\nprograms if pre-ent; otherwise it defaults to the upper text space.\nEach 1024 bytes of RAM is provided by two 2114-Ls and these must be\nadded in pairs. Each pair of 2114-Ls will provide text space for about\n64 lines of BASIC.\nTo use the lower text space IC6 must be fitted; this is a 74LS138\nin a 16 pin socket.

ICs 10 to 19 provide for up to 5 Kbytes of space\nand they must be added in the order 10 and 11, 12 and 13, 14 and 15\netc. They are all 2114-L types and they require 18 pin sockets.The\nmemory addresses contained by each pair of ICs are as follows:\nICs 10 and 11 #2800 to #2BFF.\nICs 12 and 13 #2C00 to #2FFF.\nICs 14 and 15 #3000 to #33FF.\nICs 16 and 17 #3400 to #37FF.\nICs 18 and 19 #3800 to #3BFF.\nThe # sign above indicates a hexadecimal number, #400 = 1024\nbytes. Each 2114-L consumes around 35mA, so an ATOM with the full 5K\nof lower text space will require about 1125mA.\nVIDEO GRAPHICS EXTENSION\nMore graphics RAM can be added increasing the screen resolution and\nallowing the use of the higher graphics modes. These modes are\ndescribed in the book 'Atomic Theory and Practice' and they each\nrequire different amounts of video RAM provided by fitting pairs of\n2114-Ls as follows:\nICs 42 and 43 1024 bytes = 1 KByte.\nICs 40 to 43 2048 bytes = 2 KByte.\nICs 38 to 43 3072 bytes = 3 KByte.\nICs 32 to 43 6144 bytes = 6 KByte.\nIf only ICs 42 and 43 are in use the fitting of IC30 is optional.\nWhen IC30 is not present a wire link, LK1 on side 2, must be soldered\non the circuit board. IC30 is a 74LS138 in a 16 pin socket and when it\nis fitted the wire link must be cut or removed, ICs 32 to 41 may then\nbe added.\nThe address locations provided by each pair of 2114-Ls are as\nfollows:\n\n21\nICs 42 and 43 #8000 to #83FF.\nICs 40 and 41 #8400 to #87FF.\nICs 38 and 39 #8800 to #8BFF.\nICs 36 and 37 #8C00 to #8FFF.\nICs 34 and 35 #9000 to #93FF.\nICs 32 and 33 #9400 to #97FF.\nEach 2114-L consumes about 35mA and so ATOMs with a 5 Kbyte lower\ntext space and the 5 Kbyte video RAM extension (i.e. a total video RAM\nof 6 Kbytes) will require an 1500mA supply.\nFLOATING-POINT EXTENSION\nA Read Only Memory containing the floating point, scientific\nfunctions, and colour routines may be added to the ATOM.

It will be necessary to remove the circuit board from the\ncase in order to fit the 64 way conn.actor on sid¿ ?.\nEach interface pin of the 6522 can drive one standard TTL load,\nthat is it can sink 1.6mA down to 0.4V and it can source 100uA into\n2.4V. In input mode each pin presenie one standaia TTL load.\nThe circuits below show how the 6522 can drive a lamp or relay\nand how it can sense the state of a switch or transistor. Other circuits\nmay be more suitable for some applications, these are only\nsuggestions:\nIn some applications the 6522 may need to interrupt the processor\nin which case the wire link LK2 is required which connects the\ninterrupt line to IRQ (or NMI).

AdvFS is a log-based file system that\nprovides flexibility, compatibility, data availability, and high performance.\nAdvFS takes advantage of the 64-bit computing environment and is designed\nto handle files and filesets of nearly 16 terabytes. F or hardware and software\nrequirements, see the Tru64 UNIX Software Product Description and the\nAdvFS Utilities Software Product Description.\nAdvFS Utilities, which is licensed separately from the Tru64 UNIX operating\nsystem, provides additional file management capabilities and a graphical\nuser interface (GUI) to simplify system administration.

The AdvFS GUI,\nwhich runs under the Common Desktop Environment (CDE), features\nmenus, graphical displays, and comprehensive online help that make it easy\nto perform AdvFS operations. In addition, the GUI displays summarized\nsystem status information. It includes utilities to add volumes, create clones,\nstripe files, and balance domains.\nThis guide describes AdvFS and AdvFS Utilities in detail. It provides\ninformation on features and functions, and it gives suggestions on how to\nuse these functions. Many functions can be accomplished through either the\ncommand line, the GUI, or the SysMan Menu (see sysman(8)).\nIntroducing AdvFS\nThe configuration of AdvFS differs from the traditional UNIX file system.\nIn AdvFS, the physical storage layer is managed independently of the\ndirectory layer. System administrators can add and remove storage without\nunmounting the file system or halting the operating system. As a result,\nconfiguration planning is less complicated and more flexible.\nFrom a user’s perspective, AdvFS behaves like any other UNIX file system.\nEnd users can use the mkdir command to create new directories, the cd\ncommand to change directories, and the 1s command to list directory\ncontents. AdvFS logical structures, quota controls, and backup capabilities\nare based on traditional file system design. AdvFS replaces or eliminates\nseveral standard commands, such as newfs, dump, restore, and fsck.\nAdvFS commands and utilities and a comparison of AdvFS and UFS\ncommands are detailed in Appendix B.\nWithout taking an AdvFS system off line, system administrators can\nperform backups, file system reconfiguration, and file system tuning. End\nPreface xi\n\nusers can retrieve their own unintentionally deleted files from predefined\ntrashcan directories or from clone filesets without assistance from system\nadministrators.\nAdvFS supports multivolume file systems, which enables file-level striping\n(spreading data to more than one volume) to improve file transfer rates for\n|/O-intensive applications. Logical Storage Manager (LSM), which allows\nvolume-level striping, can be incorporated into AdvFS configurations.\nAdvanced File System Features\nThe following tabl", "start_char": 19500, "end_char": 21700}

Defragmentation makes file data more\ncontiguous on the storage medium.\nOnline resizing* Thesizeof thefilesystem can be dynamically changed\nby adding or removing disk volumes while the system\nremains in use. This enables both online storage\nconfiguration and online file system maintenance.\nFile-level striping* Distributing file data across multiple disk volumes\nimproves file transfer rates.\nOnline backup* File system contents can be backed up to media\nwithout interrupting the work flow of system\nusers by using fileset clones.\nxii Preface\n\nAdvFS Features and Benefits (cont.)\nFeature Benefit\nFile undelete* Users can recover deleted files without assistance\nfrom system administrators.\nQuotas AdvFS supports quotas for users and groups\nas well as for filesets.\nGraphical user interface* The GUI simplifies file system management by\norganizing AdvFS functions into menu-selected\ntasks and by displaying file system status.\n* This feature requires the optional AdvFS Utilities license.\nWhat’s New in Tru64 UNIX Version 5.1\nThe following features have been added to AdvFS:\nAdvFS cache tuning is done through the UBC par", "start_char": 21450, "end_char": 23650}

The UFS model\nis rigid. Each disk (or disk partition) contains one separate file system; you\nmount the file system into the logical name space using mount points.\nThe directory hierarchy layer of UFS is bound tightly to the physical\nstorage layer. When a file system becomes full, this tight binding makes it\nimpossible to move selected files onto another disk without changing the\nfull path names of those files. The task of dividing a logical directory into\ndirectory subtrees and mapping the subtrees onto separate disks requires\ncareful consideration. Even with extensive planning, adjustments to the\ndirectory structure are limited with the UFS model.\nIn contrast, with AdvFS you can modify your system configuration at any\ntime without taking down the system. As your system requirements change,\nAdvFS allows you to easily adjust your storage up or down to meet your\nrequirements.\n1.1 File System Design\nAdvFS consists of two distinct layers: the directory hierarchy layer and\nthe physical storage layer. The directory hierarchy layer implements the\nfilenaming scheme and PO", "start_char": 25350, "end_char": 27550}

The directory hierarchy layer implements the\nfilenaming scheme and POSI X-compliant functions such as creating and\nopening files, or reading and writing to files. The physical storage layer\nimplements write-ahead logging, caching, file allocation, and physical disk\n1/O functions.\nThe decoupled file system structure enables you to manage the physical\nstorage layer apart from the directory hierarchy layer. This means that you\ncan move files between a defined group of disk volumes without changing\npath names for your files. Because the path names remain the same, the\naction is completely transparent to end users.\nAdvFS can incorporate Logical Storage Manager (LSM) volumes into the\nfile system structure. AdvFS configured with LSM improves file system\nreliability and availability because AdvFS can take advantage of LSM\nfeatures (See Section 1.7).\nConfiguring the File System 1-1\n\n1.1.1 Filesets, Domains and Volumes\nAdvFS implements two unique file system concepts: filesets and domains.\nFilesets and domains enable a two-layer file system structure in which\nthe physical storage layer of the file system is independent of its directory\nhierarchy. With this unique architecture, you can manage the logical\nstructure of your file systems independently of the storage volumes that\ncontain them. Figure 1-1 is a representation of this structure.\nFigure 1-1: AdvFS File System Design\nFileset A =\"\n=\nFileset B\n=\nDomain,\nVolume 1] Volume 2| Volume 3\nA fileset follows the logical structure of a traditional UNIX file system. It is\na hierarchy of directory names and file names, and it is what you mount.\nAdvFS goes beyond the traditional file system by allowing you to create\nmultiple filesets that share a common pool of storage called a domain. See\nSection 1.5 for more information about filesets.\nA domain is managed separately from the directory structure. You can add\nor remove volumes without affecting the directory structure.

You can add\nor remove volumes without affecting the directory structure. See Section 1.4\nfor more information.\nA volumeis any mechanism that behaves like a UNIX block device: an entire\ndisk, a disk partition, or an aggregate volume provided by a logical storage\nmanager (See Section 1.3). When first created, all domains consist of a single\nvolume. If you have the optional AdvFS Utilities (see License Registration ),\nyou can transform a single-volume domain into a multivolume domain by\nadding one or more volumes.\nDomain names must be unique. You cannot use slash (/), pound (#, colon (:),\nasterisk (*), question mark (?), tab, newline, formfeed, return, vertical tab,\nand space characters. Filesets that are not in the same domain can have the\nsame name and file names must be unique in the directory.\n1-2 Configuring the File System\n\n1.1.2 Transaction Log\nAdvFS is a log-based file system that employs writeahead logging to\nensure the integrity of the file system. Write-ahead logging means that\nmodifications to the metadata (the on-disk file system structures) are\ncompletely written to a transaction log before the actual changes are\nwritten to disk. Thelog is implemented as a circular file buffer so that the\ncontents of the transaction log are written to disk at regular intervals. By\ncommitting only completed transactions to disk, the file system is not left in\nan inconsistent state after an unexpected system crash.\nWhen a domain is created, AdvFS creates a transaction log for it. The first\ntime the domain is activated, 4 megabytes of storage are allocated for the\nlog. It is separate from the user data but can be stored on the same device.\nDuring crash recovery, AdvFS reads the transaction log to confirm file\nsystem transactions. All completed transactions are committed to disk and\nuncompleted transactions are undone. The number of uncommitted records\nin the log, not the amount of data in the file system, dictates the speed\nof recovery. This means that recovery usually takes only a few seconds.\nTraditional UNIX file systems rely on the fsck utility to recover froma\nsystem failure", "start_char": 29250, "end_char": 31450}

This means that recovery usually takes only a few seconds.\nTraditional UNIX file systems rely on the fsck utility to recover froma\nsystem failure. The fsck utility can take hours to check and repair a large\nfile system.\nBy default, only file system structures are logged, but you can choose\nto log file data and change the way your system writes to storage (see\nSection 4.1.4). A file that has data logging turned on will remain internally\nconsistent in the event of a system crash. However, enabling data logging\ncan slow system performance.\n1.1.3 File Storage Allocation\nFiles are not static; their space requirements change over time. To maintain\ncontiguous file placement without overallocating space on the disk, AdvFS\nuses a unique file storage allocation scheme.\nKey features of storage allocation are:\ne¢ Extents\nAn extent is a contiguous area of disk space that AdvFS allocates toa\nfile. Extents are composed of sets of one or more 8-kilobyte pages. When\nstorage is added toa file, it is grouped in extents. There is an extent map\nfor each volume on which the file system resides.\nFile |/O is most efficient when there are few extents. If a file consists of\nmany small extents, it takes morel/O processing toread or write that file.\nConfiguring the File System 1-3\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of a file system, the file-storage allocation\ncannot always guarantee contiguous placement of pages. The following\nfactors affect placement:\n- Excessive disk fragmentation\nWhen a disk is fragmented, there are many small free spaces, so\nAdvFS writes data to isolated physical pages, based on availability,\ninstead of writing to contiguous pages. This may result in files with\nmany extents.\n- Multiple users\nWhen there are many users on a system, requests for space increase,\ndecreasing the likelihood of contiguous file allocation.\nIf you have a domain with many extents, you can decrease the number\nby running the defragment utility (see Section 4.3.1).\n¢ Preallocation\nEach time a file is appended, AdvFS adds pages to the file by\npreallocating one-fourth of the file size, up to 16 pages.

Excess\npreallocated space is truncated when the file is closed.\nFor multivolume domains, new files are allocated sequentially across\nvolumes. Volumes that are more than 86% full (allocated) are not used\nfor new file allocation unless all volumes are more than 86% full. When\ndata is appended to existing files, storage is allocated on the volume on\nwhich the file was initially allocated until the volume is full.\n* Fragments\nAdvFS writes files to disk in sets of 8-kilobyte pages. In files where\nholding the last bytes in an 8-kilobyte page would represent a waste of\nmore than 5% of the allocated space, a file fragment is created. The\nfragment, which ranges in size from 1 kilobyte to 7 kilobytes, is allocated\nfrom the frag file a special file used for storing the file fragments. This\ntechnique considerably reduces the amount of unused, wasted disk space.\n¢ Sparse files\nA sparse fileis one that does not have disk storage reserved for some of\nits pages. Reading a sparse file at a page that does not have storage\nreserved returns zeroes. Writing to a page that does not have storage\nreserved allocates a page of disk storage.\nA sparse file is created by setting a file’s end-of-file with ftruncate(2) or\nby using 1seek(2) and write(2) toskip over unwritten sections of the file.\nCore files are sparse files. They have large areas with no information\nand don’t use up disk blocks for locations where no data exists. Quota\nfiles are sparse because they are indexed by user 1D. If there are gaps in\nthe user IDs, there may be sections of the file with no data.\n1-4 Configuring the File System\n\nIn contrast, database files generally reserve storage for the entire file\neven when data is not available.

The 1s command\nwith the -s option shows the amount of storage actually used by the file.\nThe du command gives the same information as the 1s -s command.\n1.2 Setting Up AdvFS\nWhen planning your configuration, consider setting up the root and /usr\nfile systems on AdvFS. Using AdvFS as the root file system enables booting\nfrom an AdvFS domain. By having the /usr file system on AdvFS, you can\nsignificantly reduce the amount of time your system is down after a system\nfailure.\nYou can set up AdvFS to resemble a traditional UFS configuration with\none partition (volume) per domain and each domain containing one fileset.\nIf you have the optional AdvFS Utilities, when space is needed you can\nadd volumes (except to the local root which is restricted to one volume) to\nincrease the size of existing domains. You do not have to change anything in\nthe existing configuration.\nThe minimum configuration needed for an active AdvFS file system is one\ndomain and one mounted fileset.\nTo create an active domain:\n1. Create a domain (see Section 1.4.5).\n2. Createa fileset (See Section 1.5.4).\n3. Create a mount-point directory (see Section 1.5.6).\n4. Mount a fileset (see Section 1.5.6).\nYou can start with one fileset per domain or you can have many. See\nSection 1.4.1 and Section 1.5.1 for guidelines.\nYou can automatically mount a fileset at system reboot (See Section 1.5.2)\nor use the AdvFS GUI or the SysMan Menu to perform this activity. See\nAppendix B for a complete list of AdvFS commands.\nFor more detailed information on AdvFS configuration, see Systen\nConfiguration and Tuning.\nConfiguring the File System 1-5\n\n1.3 Volumes\nA volume on AdvFS can bea single disk partition, an entire disk, an\naggregate volume provided by Logical Storage Manager (LSM), or hardware\nor software redundant array of independent disks (", "start_char": 35100, "end_char": 37300}

It is associated with its domain\nby a domain ID, which is automatically stored in the domain attributes\ntable of the volume. Each volume in a domain is assigned a volume index\nnumber, starting with 1, when it is initialized. Numbers are reused when\nvolumes are removed and new ones added. When a volume is removed from\na domain, the domain |D is cleared in the domain attributes table.\nIf you have the optional AdvFS Utilities, adding volumes allows you to create\na multivolume domain, increase the disk capacity of an existing domain,\nincrease the storage available for the filesets, and perform preventative disk\nmaintenance. You can add volumes immediately after creating the domain,\neven before creating and mounting filesets. To perform preventative disk\nmaintenance, you can add a new volume to the domain, migrate your files to\nthe new volume, and then remove the old volume.\nFor AdvFS to function properly, the number of volumes in a domain with the\nsame domain |D must remain consistent with the number of volumes. In\naddition, each domain is defined by an entry in the /etc/fdmns directory\n(see Section 1.4.2). This directory must be up-to-date; that is, the domain\nentries must correctly reference the volumes associated with the domains.\nThe number of links tothe volumes in the /etc/fdmns directory must equal\nthe number of volumes.\nAll volumes are labeled (see disklabel(8)) either unused or with the file\nsystem for which they were last used (for example, advfs). You can only add\na volume that is labeled unused to a domain (see Section 5.4.2).\n1.3.1 Volume Structure\nEach volumein an AdvFS domain contains the following structures:\n¢ A bitfile metadata table (BMT), which is used tostore file data structure\n(metadata), including file attributes, file extent maps, fileset attributes,\nand the POSIX file statistics.\ne A storagebitmap, which is used to track free and alloca", "start_char": 37050, "end_char": 39250}

You cannot change the way AdvFS configures the volume.\n1.3.2 Volume Attributes\nAdvFS volumes are configured with attributes that determine how data\nis read, cached, written, and consolidated. When an AdvFS volume is\nincorporated into a domain, either by creating the initial domain or by\nadding a volume, the default volume attributes are set. Modifying these\ndefault attributes may improve performance in some system configurations.\nTo display or modify the current volume attributes, use the SysMan “Manage\nan AdvFS Domain” or, from the command line, enter the chvol command:\nchvol device name file domain\nSee Chapter 4 and Systen Configuration and Tuning for more complete\ninformation on modifying attributes to improve system performance.\n1.4 Domains\nA domain is the physical storage layer of the AdvFS file system. Itisa\ndefined pool of physical storage that can contain one or more volumes.\nBecause this storage is managed separately from the directory structure (see\nSection 1.4.2), you can expand and contract the size of the domain by adding\nor removing volumes. You can move files between disks in the domain\nwithout changing file path names.\nEach domain has a unique !D that is an encoding of the date and time the\ndomain was created. If you change the name of the domain, it does not affect\nthis ID.\n1.4.1 Configuring Domains\nHow you configure domains depends on your organization’s needs.", "start_char": 39000, "end_char": 41200}

You can\nassign all available storage to a few domain or group specific partitions or\ndisks into many domains. You must also take into account how you will\nconfigure your filesets (see Section 1.5.1). With AdvFS Utilities, you can\nassign multiple volumes to a domain and distribute the filesets and files\nacross the volumes.\nEstablishing multiple domains allows greater control over your physical\nresources. You can create domains to be used by specific projects, groups of\nConfiguring the File System 1-7\n\nusers, departments, or any division that makes sense for your organization.\nFor example, you could create domains for each of your organization’s\ndepartments, such as engineering, finance, and personnel.\nThere are a number of factors to consider when configuring domains:\n¢ To maintain high performance, avoid splitting a disk between two\ndomains. For example, do not add partition g to one domain and\npartition h of the same disk to another domain.\ne Adding one partition containing the entire disk (typically, partition c)\nto a domain is preferable to adding several partitions on the same disk.\nDoing so may degrade performance. You will get an error message if you\ntry to assign overlapping partitions toa domain (see Section 1.4.6).\ne |t is generally more efficient to spread your domain over several disks,\nassuming the disks are the same type and speed. For example, a domain\nwith three volumes on separate disks is more efficient than one with\nthree partitions on a single disk because the latter has only one I/O path.\n¢ Thedefragment utility processes each volume in parallel. Thus,\ncreating a domain on several volumes can increase the defragment speed.\n¢« Combining multiple volumes within a single domain allows you to build\nlarger domains and reduces the overall management effort because fewer\ndomains require less administration.

To improve reliability,\nyou can set up LSM mirrors. See Section 1.7 for information about setting\nup AdvFS with LSM. SeeLogical StorageM anager for LSM functionality.\nThe System Configuration and Tuning guide provides detailed guidelines\nfor planning and configuring your file system. The AdvFS Software Product\nDescription (SPD) contains information about system limits. The SysMan\n“Manage an AdvFS Domain” allows you to create and configure domains.\nSee Chapter 6 if you want to configure your domains using the AdvFS GUI.\n1.4.2 The /etc/fdmns Directory\nThe /etc/fdmns directory defines domains by providing a subdirectory\nfor each domain you create. The subdirectories contain a symbolic link to\nevery volume in the domain.\nThis directory is created and maintained automatically by AdvFS when you\nuse standard AdvFS commands. You must have a current /etc/fdmns\ndirectory in order to mount the filesets in a domain.\n1-8 Configuring the File System\n\nWhen you create a domain, a soft link is created from the domain entry in\nthe /etc/fdmns directory to the block device. You cannot create a domain\nsimply by creating a link in the directory.\nBack up the /etc/fdmns directory regularly. If the contents of the directory\nbecome corrupted or deleted, restore the directory from your most recent\nbackup. A damaged directory prevents access to the domain because the\ninformation matching the domain to the physical volume containing the\nfilesets is incorrect; the filesets are not affected.\nIf you attempt to mount a fileset from a domain with a damaged directory, a\nmessage similar to the following for the domain accounts will be displayed:\nVolume count mismatch for domain accounts.\naccounts expects 2 volumes, /etc/fdmns/accounts has 1 links.\nIf you lose the /etc/fdmns directory or the volumes of a domain are moved\ntoa different syst", "start_char": 42900, "end_char": 45100}

The Version\n5.0 operating system is the first for which a new domain carries a DVN of 4.\nDomains created earlier carry a DVN of 3.\nYou can mount a DVN3 fileset on a system running Version 5.0. You cannot\nlocally mount a fileset in a DVN4 domain created under Version 5.0 or later\n(DVNA4) on a system running a Version 4 operating system. If you need to\naccess a DVN4 fileset, NFS mount it from a Version 5 or later server (see\nSection 5.1). Therefore, if your application requires backward compatibility,\nit is inadvisable to upgrade your domain to the new DVN.\nSee Section 5.1.1 for a discussion of utility incompatibility.\n1.4.3.1 Creating a Domain with DVN4\nAll domains created under Version 5.0 automatically have a DVN of 4.\nTherefore, if you do a full install of Version 5.0, all the domains created in\nthe process will have the new structure.\nConfiguring the File System 1-9\n\nIf you update install Version 5.0, your existing domains will retain the DVN\nof 3.

See showfile(8) for more information.\nTo upgrade a domain, create a new domain on a Version 5.0 or later system\nand copy all the information from the old domain to it. If you are unfamiliar\nwith creating domains, read Section 1.4.5 first. To upgrade a domain:\n1. Back up the filesets in the domain to tape with the vdump command.\nIt is a good idea to use the -x option for additional protection from\nsaveset errors. You will lose all the data in your domain if you cannot\nrestore it after creating a new domain.\n2. Remove the old domain with the rmfdmn command. This will also\nremove the old fileset.\n3.

However, a domain is not a complete file\nsystem that you can mount. In order to mount an AdvFS file system, the\ndomain must contain one or more filesets. You can access files as soon as\nyou mount one or more filesets (see Section 1.5).\nCreating a single-volume domain with a single fileset is equivalent to\ncreating a traditional UFS file system. To set up an active, single- volume\nfile system, as illustrated in Figure 1-2, use the SysMan “Create a New\nAdvFS Domain,” the AdvFS GUI or, from the command line, enter the\nmk£dmn(8) command:\nmkfdmn volume_name domain_name\nTo create an active single-volume DVN4 domain:\n1.

You can transform a single-volume domain\n(except the root domain) into a multivolume domain (see Section 1.4.6 and\nChapter 6).\nIf you try to create a domain on a volume that is in use, you will get an\nerror message. You can override the message and create the domain.

It may be possible to access the data\nwith the salvage command (see Section 5.4.6).\nTo remove a domain, use the SysMan “Manage an AdvFS Domain,” the\nAdvFS GUI (see Chapter 6) or, from the command line, unmount all filesets\nand clone filesets. Then, enter the rmfdmn command:\nrmfdmn domain _name\nFor example, to remove the domain promotions:\n# rmfdmn promotions\nrmfdmn: remove domain promotions?

When you rename\na domain, entries for all filesets in the domain must be updated in the\n/etc/f£stab file (see Section 1.5.2). To rename a domain, use the AdvFS\nGUI (see Chapter 6) or, from the command line:\nUnmount all the filesets and any related clones.\nInthe /etc/fdmns directory, change the old domain name to the new\none:\nmv /etc/fdmns/old_dom_name /etc/fdmns/new_dom_name\n3.

Filesets and traditional UNIX file systems are equivalent in many\nways: you mount AdvFS filesets, filesets contain files, are units on which\nyou enable quotas, and are units for backing up data.\nIn contrast with traditional file systems, the directory hierarchy of AdvFS\nis independent of the storage. Therefore, you can change file placement\nwithout affecting the logical structure of the filesets.\nFileset names may be associated with their domain names as in\nfiledomain#fileset. Here the pound sign (#) is part of the naming\nsyntax and does not represent a comment.\nFileset names must be unique within a domain. Each fileset has a unique\n1D composed of the domain ID and a fileset tag. Each domain has its own\nseries of fileset tags.\nAdvFS also supports clone filesets. A clone fileset is a read-only copy of\nan existing fileset created to capture data at one instant in time (see\nSection 4.1.5).\n1.5.1 Configuring Filesets\nThe filesets in a domain share the available space on the volumes in the\ndomain and use the same domain transaction log. Each fileset has its\nown directory structure, root tag directory, quota files, and frag file. The\noptimal number of AdvFS filesets in a domain depends primarily on the\nrequirements of the applications that use the filesets.\nIt is generally a good idea to have multiple filesets rather than one large\none.

For applications that perform many\n1-18 Configuring the File System\n\nfile create and remove operations, configure multiple filesets and distribute\nthe files across the filesets. This will reduce !/O and related contention.\nCreate multiple smaller filesets rather than a few large ones if you do not\nwant to share space between filesets. It is a good idea to place each or a few\nfilesets in a single domain on its own volume.\nCreate filesets containing files having similar requirements in the same\ndomain. F or example, do not place small temporary mail news server files in\nthe same domain as the database.\nBecause filesets are managed independently of their physical storage, each\nfileset can be backed up independently (see Chapter 3) and can be assigned\nits own quota limits (see Chapter 2). Multiple small filesets can be backed\nup and restored more quickly than a single large fileset. You can run the\nvdump or vrestore commands on several filesets simultaneously.\nYou can group files by their management requirements. For example, you\ncould create a fileset for developer files that will be backed up twice a day\nand you could create another fileset with quotas imposed to limit the amount\nof disk space available to the marketing department.\nBecause the one transaction log in domain is shared by all filesets, filesets\nwith a large amount of I/O can cause the transaction log to become a\nbottleneck (see Section 1.1.2). Balance the management gains of having\nmultiple filesets in a domain against the potential performance reduction\ncaused by having all of the log data for all filesets going to one transaction\nlog (See Section 4.1.3).\nYou can create and mount filesets until the system runs out of system\nresources (Such as memory or disk space).

The SysMan “Manage an AdvFS\nDomain” allows you to create and configure filesets. Many configuration\noperations can be accomplished with the AdvFS GUI (see Chapter 6).\n1.5.2 Designating Filesets in the /etc/fstab File\nAdvFS filesets are added to the /etc/fstab file by listing them with an\nadvfs designation (see fstab(4)). This is similar to the way that you add\nany other file system. AdvFS filesets listed in the /etc/fstab file are\nmounted each time you reboot the system.\nThe fileset entry includes the domain name, fileset name, mount point,\nfile system type, and the mount point options. The user quota and group\nquota options (see Section 2.2) should be included along with the pass field\nnumbers if quotas are used. If they are not desired, the user quota and group\nConfiguring the File System 1-19\n\nquota options can be omitted. An AdvFS /etc/fstab entry with user and\ngroup quotas enforced should include:\nfile dmn#fileset /mount_point advfs rw,userquota,groupquota 0 2\nFor example, to automatically mount the credit fileset with user and group\nquotas (assuming the fileset’s mount point exists), add the following line to\nthe /etc/fstab file:\nacct domain#credit /usr/credit advfs rw,userquota,groupquota 0 2\n1.5.3 Displaying Fileset Information\nAny system user can display detailed information about mounted filesets\nand clones.

You can also create multiple filesets within a domain that share the\nstorage pool established for the domain.\nEach fileset can be mounted and unmounted independently of the other\nfilesets in the domain. You can limit fileset growth within a domain by\nassigning fileset quotas (see Chapter 2).\nTo create a fileset in a domain, use the SysMan “Create a New AdvFS\nFileset,” the AdvFS GUI (see Chapter 6) or, from the command line, enter\nthe mkfset command:\nmkfset domain name fileset_name\nFor example, to create the fileset coupons in the domain advertising:\n#mkfset advertising coupons\nSee also Section 1.4.5, which contains examples for configuring an active\n(filesets mounted) domain.\n1.5.5 Upgrading a Fileset\nFilesets that are part of domains created for Version 5.0 and later (DVN4)\nsupport large quota values and have better performance for very large\ndirectories.

Filesets to be mounted must be compatible with the\noperating system on which they were created (See Section 5.1).\nTo mount a fileset, use the SysMan “Mount File Systems,” the AdvFS GUI\n(see Chapter 6) or, from the command line, enter the mount command, where\nmnt point is the path to the mount point:\nmount domain _name#fileset_name mnt_point\nFor example, to mount the fileset coupons in the domain advertising:\n#mount advertising#coupons /coupons\nBefore a fileset is mounted, AdvFS verifies that all data in all volumes ina\ndomain can be accessed. If there are problems, the mount may fail or the\nfileset may be mounted as read-only (see Section 5.4.9).\nIf you attempt to mount a fileset with an incorrect number of volumes, the\nmount operation will fail. See Section 5.5.1.2 and advscan(8) for further\ninformation.\nYou will get an error message if you attempt to mount a fileset created under\nVersion 5.0 on a system running Version 4 or earlier (See Section 5.1).\n1.5.7 Unmounting a Fileset\nIf you unmount a fileset, the fileset remains in the domain but it is not\naccessible.

If you have set up a trashcan directory (See Section 4.4) for\nthe fileset, it is also removed.\n1-22 Configuring the File System\n\nTo remove a fileset, use the SysMan “Manage an AdvFS Domain,” the AdvFS\nGUI (see Chapter 6) or, from the command line, enter the rmfset command:\nrmfset domain name fileset_name\nFor example, to remove the tmp_1 fileset in domain_1:\n# rmfset domain 1 tmp _1\nrmfset: remove fileset tmp 1? [Y/Nly\nThe fastest way to remove all filesets is to remove the domain with the\nxmf£dmn command. However, the salvage utility (See Section 5.4.6) may be\nable to access some of the data. The rmfdmn command removes the definition\nof the domain in the /etc/fdmns/ directory and relabels the volumes, but it\ndoes not touch any data on the volume. Filesets removed with the rmfset\ncommand are not recoverable with the salvage utility because the utility\ndestroys pointers to the fileset data (metadata) and all the files in the fileset.\n1.5.9 Renaming a Fileset\nAn unmounted fileset can be renamed. Filesets are known tothe system by\ntheir fileset identifier, which is a combination of the domain identifier and\nan additional set of numbers that identify the fileset within the domain.\nThe fileset name is kept within the domain and is an attribute that you\nassign. When you rename a fileset, only this assignment is changed.

You must delete the old clone and\ncreate a new one.\n1.5.10 Clone Filesets\nIf you have the optional AdvFS Utilities, you can back up your files using\na clone fileset, a read-only snapshot of fileset data structures (metadata).\nWhen you clone a fileset (create a clone fileset), the utility copies only the\nstructure of the original fileset, not the actual data. Only when a file is\nmodified does the file system copy the original, unchanged data to the clone\nfileset. (This is called copy-on-write.) Because the only data in the clone\nfileset is a copy of data that has been modified, the clone fileset is usually\nsmaller than the original fileset. Figure 1-4 illustrates the relationship\nbetween parent and clone filesets.\nFigure 1-4: Cloning a Fileset\nFileset A (Parent Fileset) Clone Fileset |\nIL_] aawe!t hae\nCod =\n=——— ee\nDomain ( = = | -z)\ncs la.\nVolume 11 Volume 2 Copy-on-write im Versions of\nModified Files\nClone filesets increase the availability of data because they:\ne Preserve the system at a particular time\nA clone is not a replacement for the backup process (using the vdump\ncommand, for example).

By\nleaving the clone fileset on line, you can replace unintentionally deleted\nor corrupted files without loading backup tapes.\nSee Section 3.2 for command line instructions on using cloning for online\nbackup and Section 6.4.3 for an explanation of cloning with the AdvFS GUI.\nNote\nChanging text files with an editor may cause the entire original\nfile to be copied to the clone. Many editors rewrite the entire file\nregardless of what has changed. When this happens, your clone\nfileset may grow very large. Thereis no way for AdvFS to alter\nthis process.\nWhen you delete a file that existed when the clone was created, it remains\navailable (but not visible in the original fileset) for the life of the clone. The\nfile is not copied to the clone, but the actual delete is delayed until the done\nis deleted. The version of the file that is retained is the one that existed\nwhen the clone was created. Later updates are lost.\nThe size of the clone fileset depends upon the number of updates that occur\nduring the life of the clone. The df command, which displays statistics\non free disk space, does not accurately reflect the size of the clone fileset\nbecause it constantly changes as files are updated.\nCaution\nWhen a domain runs out of disk space, the file system loses its\nability to maintain the consistency of files within clone filesets.\nThe original fileset is usable, but the clone fileset is not accurate.\nA warning message is displayed on both the user’s terminal and\nthe system console.\n1.5.10.1 Creating a Clone Fileset\nCloning is transparent to the user and has little impact on system\nperformance.

See the Installation Guide for instructions on\ninstalling AdvFS as the root file system during the initial installation.\n1.6.1 Mounting the root File System in Single-User Mode\nThe root file system is automatically mounted as read-only when the system\nis booted in single-user mode. You can change the root fileset mount from\nread-only to read-write with the mount -u command:\nmount -u /\nUse this procedure when you need to make modifications to the root\nconfiguration.

The name of a root domain is stored as the\ndirectory name in the /etc/fdmns directory and in the entry for root in\nthe /etc/fstab file.\n1.6.3 Changing the Name of the root Fileset\nChanging the name of the root fileset is similar to changing the name of any\nother fileset (see Section 1.5.9). There are, however, two complications:\n« The renamefset command requires that the fileset be unmounted, and\nyou cannot unmount the root fileset.\n¢« You must edit the /etc/fstab filet oc hange the name of the root fileset.\nTo do this, you must make the root fileset writable. But the root fileset\ncannot be mounted as writable unless the /etc/fstab entry is correct.\nTherefore, you must use an alternate bootable partition and manipulate the\nroot fileset you are changing as you would an ordinary fileset, make the\nchanges, then reboot the changed fileset as root.\nTo rename the root fileset:\n1.

To place specific data on mirrored or\nstriped volumes, create an AdvFS domain that contains only LSM volumes\nwith the attributes that you want.

This configuration provides distributed processing and\nfail-over protection; since both disks contain the same information, either\none can be accessed. Logical Storage M anager provides detailed instructions\nfor creating LSM mirrored volumes.\nThe following example creates a 500-megabyte mirrored LSM volume with\na domain and one mounted fileset:\n# volassist make mirr_vol 500m nmirror=2\n# mkfdmn /dev/vol/rootdg/mirvro l domainl\n# mkfset domainl fset1\n# mount domainl#fset 1 /mnt\nTo back up the LSM volume, split the mirror.

Therefore, if you\nfind that a file has become large or has heavy I/O requirements, you can use\nthe AdvFS stripe command to stripe it.\nIt is not advisable to do both LSM and AdvFS striping because this may\ndegrade system performance.\nThe following example creates a striped LSM volume and then creates an\nAdvFS domain using that striped LSM volume. All files created in this\nAdvFS domain will be striped across LSM volumes:\n# volassist make vol06 600m layout=stripe nstripe=3\n# mkfdmn /dev/vol/rootdg/vol06 striped domain\n1-32 Configuring the File System\n\n2\nManaging Quotas\nAdvFS§ allows you to activate quotas to track and control the amount of\nphysical storage that each user, group, or fileset consumes. You must have\nroot user privilege to set and edit quotas. The root user is never restricted by\nquota limits; quota limits only apply to nonroot users.\nThe AdvFS quota system is compatible with the Berkeley-style quotas of\nUFS. However, the AdvFS quota system differs in two ways:\ne AdvFS differentiates between quota maintenance and quota\nenforcement. Quota information is always maintained, but enforcement\ncan be activated and deactivated.\n¢« AdvFS supports fileset quotas; that is, you can set quota limits for the\nfilesets in a domain.\n2.1 Introducing Quotas\nYou can set two quota values: on the amount of disk storage and on the\nnumber of files. 1n addition there are two types of quotas you can set:\ne User and group quotas\nAdvFS user and group quotas are similar to UFS quotas. You can set a\nseparate quota for each user or each group of users for each fileset.\ne Fileset quotas\nYou can restrict the space that a fileset itself can use.

Fileset quotas are\nuseful when a domain contains multiple filesets. Without fileset quotas,\nany fileset can grab all of the disk space in the domain.\nFor example, it is useful to set quotas on filesets that contain home\ndirectories such as /usr/users because these filesets can grow rapidly.\nConversely, setting quota limits on the /tmp fileset is not recommended\nbecause this fileset is likely to fluctuate in size.\n2.1.1 Quota Limits\nLimits are set on disk usage (number of blocks) or on number of files (inodes)\nor both. Table 2-1 shows the size limits for both types of quota values.\nManaging Quotas 2-1\n\nTable 2-1: Quota Size Limits\nUser and Group Quotas Fileset Quotas\nDisk Usage 8 billion terabytes* 4 billion terabytes\nNumber ofF iles 4 billion 4 billion\n* Prior to Version 5.0, the disk usage limit for user and group quotas was 2\nterabytes. If your domain was created prior to Version 5.0, and if you are\nnow running Version 5.0 or later, you must upgrade your domain if you wish\nto take advantage of the new limits (See Section 1.4.3).\nAll quotas can have two types of limits: hard and soft. A hard limit cannot\nbe exceeded. No more space can be allocated or files created. A soft limit\npermits a period of time during which the limit can be exceeded as long as\nthe hard limit has not been exceeded.\nHard and soft limits can be set or changed by the root user at any time and\ntake effect the next time quotas are activated. Hard and soft limits can be\nset for users, for groups, and for filesets.\nThe default is no quota limit. You can also:\ne Set the hard limit to 0 blocks or files to impose no quota limits.\ne¢ Set the hard limit to 1 block or file to permit no disk space allocations.\n¢ Set the soft limit to 1 block or file and the hard limit to 0 blocks or files to\npermit disk-space allocations on a temporary basis.

When the grace\nperiod expires, no one can create new files or allocate any more disk space\nuntil enough files are deleted to fall below the soft limit. Updating existing\nfiles may cause loss of data.\nThe timer for the grace period starts when the user exceeds the soft limit. If\nyou allow no grace period, the user can exceed the soft limit only once. The\ngrace period is turned off and reset each time usage drops below the soft\nlimit. If you change the grace period after the user has exceeded the soft\nlimit, the old grace period stays in effect until usage drops below the limit.\n2-2 Managing Quotas\n\nYou can set grace periods for:\ne Users\nFor each fileset you can set only one grace period for all users (See\nSection 2.2.2). If the user grace period expires, the user cannot allocate\nstorage in the fileset until enough files are deleted to fall below the soft\nlimit. The grace periods for the number of blocks and for the number of\nfiles do not need to be the same.\n¢ Groups\nFor each fileset you can only set one grace period for all groups (see\nSection 2.2.2). If the group grace period expires, no one in the group can\nallocate storage in the fileset until enough files are deleted to fall below\nthe soft limit. All users are limited by the group grace period, even if\nthe fileset grace period is larger.\ne Filesets\nThe fileset grace period is the same as the group grace period (see\nSection 2.3.2.2). Any user or group can cause the fileset to exceed its soft\nlimit and thereby evoke the fileset grace period. Any user or group (not\nnecessarily the one that exceeded the limit) can delete files to bring the\nfileset below the soft limit.\nAdvFS sets a default grace period of 7 days.

Quota files are present in the fileset even if\nquota limits have not been established.\nAdvFS keeps user and group quota information in the root directory of the\nfileset in the quota.user and quota.group files. These files are created\nwhen the fileset is created. They are indexed by user |D and group 1D. Each\nquota file entry contains the following information: hard block limit, soft\nManaging Quotas 2-3\n\nblock limit, block usage, hard file limit, soft file limit, file usage, block grace\nperiod, and file grace period.\nQuota files are sparse files (See Section 1.1.3); that is, there are holes in the\nfile where no user |Ds or group |Ds fall. Use the 1s command with the -1\noption to see the space spanned by the quota.user or the quota. group\nfile. This does not show the actual disk usage. For example:\n# ls -1 quota.user\n-rw-r----- 1 root operator 294912 Jul 20 08:50 quota.user\nUse the 1s command with the -s option to display how many blocks the\nfile actually uses:\n# 1s -s quota.user\n16 quota.user\nTo enforce user and group quotas for a fileset, the /etc/fstab file must\nhave the following quota mount point options for the fileset:\nadvfs rw,userquota,groupquota 0 2\nYou can relocate the quota.user and quota. group files to subdirectories\nof the fileset. However, you cannot relocate them to other filesets nor delete\nthem. If you relocate your files, you must update the /etc/fstab file entry\nto include the path and name of the relocated file(s) in the userquota and\ngroupquota parameters.\nFor example, to relocate the quota.user", "start_char": 93600, "end_char": 95800}

If you relocate your files, you must update the /etc/fstab file entry\nto include the path and name of the relocated file(s) in the userquota and\ngroupquota parameters.\nFor example, to relocate the quota.user file to the subdirectory d4 and\nrename it nquot, change the /etc/fstab entry to:\ndom_ l#fset /mnt advfs rw,userquota=/mnt/d4/nquot,groupquota 0 2\nIn this example, the group quota file is not moved.\nWhether or not you relocate your quota files, you do not need to enforce\nquotas. See Section 2.2.7 for instruction on deactivating user and group\nquotas.\n2.2.2 Setting Quotas and Grace Periods\nYou are not required to set both user and group quotas. If you specify a group\nquota, it will apply to all users belonging to that group. If you specify a user\nquota that is larger than the group quota, it will have no effect because the\ngroup quota will take effect before the user quota is reached.\nUse the edquota command to set the quotas for users and groups and\nagain to change the grace period. The fileset must be mounted before you\ncan set quotas and grace periods. Note that for each fileset, only one grace\nperiod can be set for all users and one grace period can be set for all groups.\nHowever, you do not have to set the same grace period for the number of\n2-4 Managing Quotas\n\nblocks and for the number of files. The group grace period you set is also\nentered as the fileset grace period (see Section 2.3.2.2).\nFollow these general steps to set user and group quotas and grace periods:\nAdd quota file mount point options to the /etc/fstab file.\n2. Enter the edquota command with the -u option to set user quotas\nor the -g option to set group quotas. An ASCII representation of the\nquota file is displayed through the editor specified by the EDITOR\nenvironmental variable. If EDITOR is not set, the vi editor is used.\n3.

Use the quotaon command to activate quotas (See Section 2.2.5 and\nSection 2.2.6). If you are changing quota limits and quotas have already\nbeen activated for a fileset, the new limits become effective immediately.\nIf you have set quotas for a single user, you can use the edquota command\nwith the -p option to create prototype quota files. Then you can apply the\nprototype quota to other users that you specify (See Section 2.2.3).\n2.2.2.1. User Quotas Example\nThe following example sets quotas for the user user5:\n1. If they do not already exist, add quota mount-point options to the\n/etc/fstab file.

If you do not specify a grace period, the grace period remains at the\nAdvFS default of 7 days. You can set different grace periods for the number\nof blocks and for the number of files. If the group grace period is less than a\nuser grace period, the user is limited by the group grace period.\nThe following example sets the grace period for all users of fileset test 3:\n1.

Note that you do not have to set multiple grace periods because,\nfor each user or group quota, one grace period per fileset applies to all users\nor to all groups.\nUse the edquota command with the -p option to take existing quota\ninformation and establish it as a prototype user or group quota. Then apply\nthe prototype to one or more users or groups.\nFor example, to set up all student accounts to have the same disk usage\nquota:\n1. Establish a set of quotas for a single student. Use the edquota\ncommand with the desired limits.\nUse the edquota command with the -p option to apply the quotas set\nup for the first user to other student accounts.\n2.2.3.1 Prototype User Example\nThe following example sets up prototype-user quotas that are then used to\nmodify the quotas for other users:\n1.

See the appropriate reference pages.\nIf you are enforcing quotas, you can periodically verify your quota setup. You\ncan display user and group quota information in a number of ways. If you\nare not the root user, you can display information only for your own files.\n2-10 Managing Quotas\n\nThe root user can display all user and all group quota information for all\nfilesets.

Users can run this command to look at their own disk\nspace usage. The root user can look at usage for the whole system.\nYou can choose to display quota information for users or groups, for all\nfilesets with usage over quota, or for all mounted filesets regardless of\nwhether quotas are activated.\nThe quota command displays the block usage of the fileset, soft limit (quota),\nhard limit (limit), grace period, and number of files used for each user. An\nasterisk (*) in a column means that a soft quota limit has been exceeded.\nNote that the grace period is not displayed unless the soft limit has been\nexceeded.

It examines user and group files,\nbuilds a table of current disk usage, and compares this table with that stored\nin the disk quota file. If any inconsistencies are detected, AdvFS updates\nboth the quota file(s) and the current system copy.\nIf you do not activate quotas automatically at system start-up (See\nSection 2.2.5), it is a good practice to run the quotacheck command when\nquotas are first activated (see Section 2.2.6). To ensure accuracy, run this\ncommand when there is no activity on the system.\nThe quotacheck command only checks filesets that have the userquota or\ngroupquota option specified in the /etc/fstab file (See Section 2.2.2). By\ndefault both user and group quotas are checked, but you can specify either\nby selecting the -u option for user or the -g option for group.\nThe quotacheck command requires that filesets be mounted with quotas\nactivated. Select the -v option (verbose) to display inconsistencies found and\nprocedures performed during the checking process.\nThe following example shows a verbose check of the fileset set_1 that\ndisplays no inconsistencies:\n# quotacheck -v domain l#set_1\n*** Checking user and group quotas for domain_l#set_1 (/test1)\nThe following example checks all filesets that have quotas defined in\nthe /etc/fstab file. In this example the quotacheck command fixes\ninconsistencies in /usr:\n# quotacheck -va\n*** Checking user and group quotas for /dev/rdisk/dsk0g (/usr)\n*** Checking user and group quotas for domain_l#set_1 (/test1)\n/usr: root fixed: inodes 3057 -> 3022 blocks 1", "start_char": 113100, "end_char": 115300}

To be included in the summary, the fileset must have a\nquota entry in the /etc/fstab file. By default both user and group quotas\nare reported, but you can specify either by using the -u option for user or the\n-g option for group.\nManaging Quotas 2-13\n\nFor each user or group, the repquota command prints the current number\nof files, the amount of space used, and the quota limits established with the\nedquota command.\nThe following example summarizes quotas for a single fileset mounted on\n/testl:\n# repquota -v /testl\n*** Report for user quotas on /testl (domain _1#set_1)\nBlock limits File limits\nUser used soft hard grace used soft hard grace\nroot -- 34088 0 0 12:3 0 0\nuser5 -- 816 20000 30000 9 350 500\nThe following example displays user and group quota information for all\nfilesets in /etc/fstab that have quotas defined.

Edit the\nQUOTA_CONFIG option to read:\nQUOTA CONFIG=\"yes\"\nThis entry causes the /sbin/init .d quota script torun the quotaon and\nquotacheck commands.\nThen, edit the /etc/fstab file entry toadd userquota and groupquota to\nthe mount point. Quota enforcement is activated for the mounted fileset the\nnext time and every time you reboot.\nFor example, if you wanted to activate a quota on the fileset wA in the\ndomain expenses, the /etc/fstab entry would be:\nexpenses#WA /WA advfs rw,userquota,groupquota 0 2\nNote\nIf you unmount a fileset when quota enforcement is active, you\nmust explicitly reactivate quota enforcement with the quotaon\ncommand when you remount the fileset. This must be done even\nif there is a QUOTA_CONFIG=\"yes\" entry.\n2.2.6 Activating Quotas Manually\nIf your system is running, enter the quotaon command to activate new\nquotas for a mounted fileset. To establish new user or group quotas do the\nfollowing:\n1. Edit the /etc/fstab file entry for your fileset to add userquota and\ngroupquota tothe mount point.\n2.

Runthe quotaon command to activate the quotas you have chosen.\nManaging Quotas 2-15\n\nIf your system is set up to initialize quotas at system start-up (see\nSection 2.2.5), you do not need to run the quotaon command again unless\nyou have unmounted your fileset. If your system does not include quota\nenforcement, you must run the quotaon command to start enforcement\neach time you reboot.\nThe following example activates quotas for the filesets for which quota\nvalues were set in the previous sections:\n# quotaon -av\n/testl: group quotas turned on\n/testl: user quotas turned on\n/test3: group quotas turned on\n/test3: user quotas turned on\n/test4: group quotas turned on\n/test4: user quotas turned on\nBy default, both user and group quotas are affected by the quotaon and\nquotaoff commands. You can choose to activate quotas either for users\n(with the -u option) or for groups (with the -g option). You can also specify\nthe filesets for which user or group quotas will be enforced (see Section 2.3.5\nfor information on fileset quotas).\n2.2.7 Deactivating Quotas\nYou can turn off quota enforcement either temporarily or permanently. You\ncan obtain file and disk space usage information regardless of whether you\nare enforcing quotas.\nThe quotaoff command turns off quota enforcement until the quotaon\ncommand is run again either manually or through system initialization\nthat turns quotas on.\nThe umount command turns off quotas before it unmounts a fileset. If you\nremount the fileset, you must run the quotaon command to enforce user\nand group quotas for the fileset.\nIf you want to permanently turn quotas off for a user or group, use the\nedquota command to set quota limits to 0 (zero). To prevent quotas from\never being activated for a fileset, run the quotaoff command.

For information on setting\nfileset quotas from the AdvFS GUI, see Chapter 6.\n2-16 Managing Quotas\n\n2.3.1 Quota Files\nAdvFS keeps fileset soft and hard limits in the structural information\nassociated with the fileset. You do not have direct access to this file. It\ncontains the same type of information that the user and group quota files\ncontain: hard and soft limits for number of blocks and hard and soft limits\nfor number of files. For a given fileset, the fileset grace period is the same\nas the group grace period.\n2.3.2 Setting Quotas and Grace Periods\nFileset quotas limit the number of files or the amount of disk space a\nfileset can use. You can set both soft and hard limits. If fileset quotas are\nnot imposed, any fileset has access to all of the available disk space in the\ndomain. The fileset quotas are set with the chfsets command. If fileset\nquotas are set, they are activated whenever you mount the fileset.\nThe fileset grace period is the same as the group grace period (see\nSection 2.3.2.2). If you do not set a grace period, the grace period remains at\nthe AdvFS default grace period of 7 days.\nUsethe chfsets command to define fileset quota values. You can set a soft\nlimit for the number of files (-F option), a hard limit for the number of files\n(-£ option), a soft limit for block usage (-B option), and a hard limit for block\nusage (-b option). The command displays both the old and new limits.\n2.3.2.1 Fileset Quotas Example\nThe following example sets fileset quotas for the set_1 filesetin dmn_2.\nNote that unlike the quota commands, the showfsets command displays\nblock usage in 512-byte blocks. If you wish to display kilobyte values, use\nthe -k option.\n1.

If\nyou specify only a fileset name, the output is the same as that of the df\ncommand. If you specify a domain, the utility also displays the number of\ndisk blocks used for metadata.

The rvdump and rvrestore commands provide\nthe same capabilities for remote storage devices. In addition, the AdvFS\nclonefset utility can be used with the vdump command to back up online\nAdvFS filesets. Clonefilesets provide a static snapshot of files for the backup.\nThe vdump command can be used to back up AdvFS filesets as well as UFS\nand other standard file systems. This means that you can havea single\nbackup utility for your facility. The dump and restore commands function\ndifferently from the vdump and vrestore commands. The dump command\nworks at the inode level soit can handle only UFS files. The vdump command\nworks at the file level. It scans the directories and uses regular POSIX file\nsystem calls to access directories and files. See vdump(8) and vrestore(8)\nfor more information.\nIn the discussion that follows, only the vdump and vrestore commands are\nmentioned, but the rvdump and rvrestore commands can be substituted\nfor remote operation.\nNote\nThe tools you use to back up and to restore files must be\ncompatible.

For example, if you use the vdump or the rvdump\ncommand to back up a file system, you must use the vrestore\nor the rvrestore command to restore saved files. You cannot\nuse the vrestore command to restore files backed up with the\ndump command.\nYou do not have to be root user to use the vdump and vrestore commands.\nHowever, the AdvFS quota files and the fileset quotas for the fileset can be\nsaved and restored only when the root user initiates the command. You must\nhave write permission for the directory to which you want to restore files.\nBacking Up and Restoring 3-1\n\nNote\nThe vrestore command for operating system versions earlier\nthan Version 4.0 will not properly restore information saved by\nthe vdump command for Version 4.0 or later. The vdump and\nvrestore dump file formats are compatible in Version 4 and\nVersion 5.\n3.1 Backing Up Data\nThe vdump command creates a list of fixed-size blocks, called a saveset, as\nit copies all files that are new or have changed after a certain date to the\ndefault storage device or the device that you specify.\nA saveset can span multiple tapes or a tape can contain multiple savesets.\nSavesets on tapes are delimited by file marks that are written when the\nsaveset is closed by the vdump command.\nTo enter a vdump command:\nvdump options mount _point\nFor example, to dump the filesets mounted at /psm to tape:\n# vdump -0 -f£ /dev/tape/tape0 /psm\n3.1.1 Unique Features of the vdump Command\nThe vdump command has a number of functions that the UFS dump\ncommand does not have. You can:\n¢« Save mounted filesets.\n¢ Choose a subdirectory that you want to back up. You do not need to\ndump an entire fileset.\n¢« Compress files to minimize the saveset size.\n¢ Specify the number of in-memory buffers.

Set\nthe -N option to specify no rewind or specify a no-rewind device such as\n/dev/ntape/tapeo. This ensures that the tape does not rewind when\nthe dump finishes.\nIf a Saveset requires more than one tape to complete, you will be prompted to\nmount another.\nDo not combine the output from the dump and vdump utilities on the same\ntape. If the vrestore command is used to recover files from a tape created\nby the dump utility, the results are unpredictable and can result in data loss.\n3.1.3 Dumping Subdirectories\nYou can selectively back up individual subdirectories of a fileset by specifying\nthe subdirectory with the -D option of the vdump command. Without the -D\noption, if you specify a subdirectory instead of a fileset on the command line,\nthe vdump command backs up the entire fileset that contains the named\nsubdirectory. If you specify the -D option, backup is always run at level 0.\n3.1.4 Dumping to Filesets\nWhen the backup saveset device is the character dash (-), the vdump\ncommand writes to standard output. Thus, the vdump and vrestore\ncommands can be used in a pipeline expression to copy one fileset to another.\nThe following are typical commands; they are equivalent:\n#vdump -0f - /usr | vrestore -xf - -D /mnt\n#vdump -0 -f - /usr | (cd /mnt; vrestore -x -f -)\nThe rvdump and rvrestore commands are unable to use the character -.\nThe output device must be specified.\n3.1.5 Dumping to Block 0\nIf you attempt to dump tothe first block of a disk partition that contains a\nvalid disk label, the device driver will not overwrite the disk label.

If you do\nnot, the vdump command may appear to contain valid savesets, but when\nthe vrestore command attempts to interpret the disk label as part of the\nsaveset, it will return the message:\nvrestore: unable to use save-set; invalid or corrupt format\nThis is also true for the rvdump and rvrestore commands.\nTo correctly dump tothe first disk block, begin by clearing the disk label with\nthe disklabel command and the -z flag. See vdump(8) and vrestore(8)\nfor more information.\n3.1.6 Compressing Savesets\nYou can compress savesets as they are backed up. This reduces the amount\nof storage required for the backup and allows the dump to run faster on\nslow devices because less data is written. Use the -c option with the vdump\ncommand to request compression. You cannot specify the compression ratio;\nit is determined by the contents of the dump.\nNote\nIf you are using a tape drive that automatically does hardware\ncompression, using the vdump command with compression may\nresult in a larger saveset than expected. Sometimes, due to\ncompression algorithms, already compressed data gets expanded\nwhen an attempt is made to do more compression.\n3.1.7 Dumping with Error Protection\nYou can use the -x option with the vdump command to place checksum\nblocks on your tape so that the vrestore command can recover damaged\nblocks. The vdump command creates these blocks every n number of blocks\nyou specify. The valid range of n is 2 to 32; the default is 8. If the vrestore\ncommand detects a read error in a block, it uses the other blocks and the\nchecksum block to recreate the bad block.\nDumping with error protection requires saving one extra block for every n\nblocks. It can correct only one block in each series of n blocks when the\nblocks are resto", "start_char": 138450, "end_char": 140650}

This means there is a trade-off:\n¢ If you believe tapes are error prone or you require extremely accurate\nbackups and you have many tapes available for backup, set the value\nof -x to2. This will permit error correction of one bad block for every\ntwo blocks saved. It will require 50% more tape because after every two\ndump blocks, a checksum block will be written.\n3-4 Backing Up and Restoring\n\n¢ If you believe that tapes are generally reliable but you want to be able\nto correct a rare bad block, set the value of -x to 32. This will require\n3% more tape because an extra block will be added for every 32 blocks\nwritten. You could then recover information from any one bad block\nin the group of 32 dump blocks.\n3.1.8 Backup Level\nYou can specify the level of incremental backup in the vdump command. A\nvalue of 0 specifies complete fileset backup. A higher number specifies a less\ncomplete backup. See vdump(8) for more information.\nThe vdump command operates by checking the file modification date. This\nmay cause problems on a subsequent incremental backup because the file\nmodification date does not change if you rename or move a file and don’t\nmodify the data. Thus, if you back up your files then move or rename them,\nchange the modification date using the touch command:\ntouch file name\n3.1.9 Listing Saved Files\nYou can check your saveset and make sure you have backed up the files\nyou intended. After your backup is complete, run the vrestore command\nwith the -t option to display the files you have saved. This will not initiate\nthe restore procedure.\n3.1.10 Dumping and Restoring Files Remotely\nThe rvdump command backs up files from a single mounted fileset or a clone\nfileset to a remote storage device.

See rsh(8) for\nserver and client access rules.\nThe rvdump command has the same options as the vdump command, but you\nmust specify the nod", "start_char": 140400, "end_char": 142600}

If\nyou have the optional AdvFS Utilities, you can create a clone. You must be\nthe root user to clone the root fileset.\nA clone does not contain all the data at the time it is created. Rather, it is\nan outline of the data structure. Data in the original fileset that remains\nunchanged over the life of the clone is never saved in the clone fileset. When\nyou modify the data in your original files, AdvFS saves the data that existed\nin the original, page by page, into the clone.\nYou can create a clone fileset for any AdvFS fileset with the command-line\ninterface (See Section 1.5.10) or with the AdvF S GUI (see Section 6.4.3). You\ncannot clone UFS file systems. Only one clone can exist per fileset.\nA clone is useful if the files in your system are changing during the time you\nwish to do your backup. It reflects the state of your system at the moment it\nwas created and backing it up does not interfere with current processing.\nNote\nAfter you have finished your backup, delete the clone. Clones of\nactive filesets will continue to grow as the files are changed.\nThe following example backs up the pssm fileset on line by creating the\npssm_clone fileset and backing it up to the default device. The domain\nin this example is domain1.\n# clonefset domainl pssm pssm_ clone\n# mkdir /pssm_clone\n# mount -t advfs domainl#pssm_clone /pssm_clone\n# vdump -0 -u -C /pssm_clone\nTo remove the pssm_clone fileset, enter:\n# umount /pssm_ clone\n# rmfset domainl#pssm_ clone\n3.3 Cloning to Back Up Databases\nIf your database has an online backup utility,", "start_char": 142350, "end_char": 144550}

Backing up a database\nwith a clone fileset is the same as backing up any other fileset. You get\nthe same benefits (see Section 3.2).\n3-6 Backing Up and Restoring\n\nTo back up a database with a clone:\n1. Shut down the database so that all database buffers are flushed and the\nfileset has a complete, consistent copy of the database files.\nClone the fileset and mount the clone.\nReactivate the database.\nWhen you want to back up the clone fileset, run a backup procedure.\nuWFN Unmount and delete the clone.\nCaution\nDo not use anything except the database's own utilities to back\nup an active database. You can use the vdump and vrestore\ncommands on a clone fileset that contains the database.\nIf your database has files spread over multiple AdvFS filesets, it is a good\nidea to create a clone on each of the filesets at the sametime. This ensures a\nconsistent back up of all the database information.\n3.4 Restoring Data\nThe vrestore command restores files by processing the blocks from a\nsaveset created with the vadump command. The vrestore command will not\nwork on a saveset created by the UFS dump command.\nYou do not have to be root user torun the vrestore command, but you must\nhave write privilege for the directory you will restore to. Only the root user\ncan restore quota files and fileset quotas. See vrestore(8) for details.\n3.4.1 Unique Features of the vrestore Command\nThe vrestore command performs a number of activities that the UFS\nrestore command does not. You can:\n¢ Display the current vrestore version number.\n¢ Display the source directory path.\ne List the saveset structure.\n¢ Display error messages only. Information messages will not be shown.\n¢ Specify how the vrestore command should proceed if it encounters\na file that already exists.

It can restore data from a file, a pipe, magnetic tapes, or disks.\nUse the same version of the vdump and vrestore utilities. If your version\nof the vrestore utility is unable to read the format of your saveset, you\nwill get an error message.\nBefore you restore files, you can check if the saveset you are accessing\ncontains the information you wish to recover. You can list the names and\nsizes of all files in the saveset by running the vrestore command using the\n-t option. The restore operation will not be performed. You can also display\nthe files and directories saved by running the vrestore command with\nthe -i option. This interactive option allows you to select individual files\nor directories to restore from a list.\nRestoring data from a clone fileset is the same as restoring data from any\nother fileset.\nStart with the full backup if you are restoring an entire fileset. Then restore\nlater incremental backups on top of this to retrieve files that have changed\nsince the full backup was created. Files that were deleted after the full\nbackup was performed are restored. It is necessary to delete these files\nmanually.\n3.4.3 Restoring Quotas\nAdvFS user and group quota files can be restored either to an AdvFS fileset\nor toa UFS file system. If AdvFS quota files are to be restored toa UFS file\nsystem, quotas must be activated on the UFS file system. AdvFS fileset\nquotas cannot be restored to a UFS file system because there is no UFS\nanalog to AdvFS fileset quotas. You must be root user to restore quotas.\n3.4.4 Restoring Selected Savesets\nTo restore to the current working directory from a tape containing multiple\nsavesets, use the mt command with the fsf n (forward space n savesets", "start_char": 146250, "end_char": 148450}

Then use the\nvrestore command.\nThe following example selects and restores the fourth saveset on a tape:\n# mt fsf 3\n# vrestore -xf /dev/ntape/tape0\nThe vrestore command can also selectively restore files from your saveset\nwith the -x option followed by the file names. You can specify a destination\npath other than the current directory for the restored files.\n3-8 Backing Up and Restoring\n\nThe following example restores the file named data_file fromthe\n/mnt /fdump saveset.

NetWorker\ncan automatically back up multiple servers in a heterogeneous environment.\nIt has a graphical interface and several scheduling options.\nIf filesets will be accessed by users during the backup process, use the\nAdvFS clonefset utility to clone all filesets for backup and mount the\nclone filesets. (You can create a script to accomplish this task.) Then, set\nup NetWorker to automatically back up the clone filesets on a convenient\nschedule.\nBacking Up and Restoring 3-9\n\n4\nOptimizing Performance\nAdvFS provides a number of ways to configure and tune your file system.\nSome of the tuning functions are available through the AdvFS GUI (see\nChapter 6). The Systen Configuration and Tuning manual provides detailed\ninformation.\n4.1 AdvFS Organization\nYou will obtain the best performance if you carefully plan your AdvFS\nconfiguration. You can control how you configure your domains and how you\nallocate disks. You can turn on direct |/O to speed data transfer. You can\nmake choices about transaction logging and file structure.\n4.1.1 Configuring Domains and Filesets\nThere is a trade-off in using one large", "start_char": 148200, "end_char": 150400}

You can turn on direct |/O to speed data transfer. You can\nmake choices about transaction logging and file structure.\n4.1.1 Configuring Domains and Filesets\nThere is a trade-off in using one large domain instead of several smaller\nones. Because each domain has one transaction log, creating a single large\ndomain decreases maintenance complexity at the cost of putting a greater\nload on the log, which may become a bottleneck (see Section 1.4.1).\nDomains that were created on operating systems prior to Version 5.0 do\nnot have the structure necessary to provide large quota values and better\nperformance for directories containing thousands of files. If either of these\nnew features is important to you, update your domains (see Section 1.4.3).\nMultiple filesets in a domain are generally more efficient than a single large\none (See Section 1.5.1).\nSee Systen Configuration and Tuning for more detailed information about\nallocating domains and filesets effectively.\n4.1.2 Configuring Volumes\nIf you have AdvFS Utilities, you can add multiple volumes to an AdvFS\ndomain. This may improve performance because I/O processes can run in\nparallel. However, without LSM disk mirroring, it is inadvisable to add\nmore than eight volumes. If you lose a volume, the entire domain becomes\ninaccessible. The risk of losing a volume, and thus losing access to your\ndomain, increases as the number of volumes increases.\nOptimizing Performance 4-1\n\nIn many cases, there is a significant performance advantage to dividing\ndisks on different SCSI busses. See System Configuration and Tuning for\nmore detailed information.\n4.1.3 Improving Transaction Log Performance\nEach domain has a transaction log that keeps track of fileset activity for all\nfilesets in the domain. This requires a high volume of read/write activity to\nthe log file. If the log resides on a congested disk or bus, or if the domain\ncontains many filesets, system performance can degrade.

Following are several ways of writing toa file:\nAsynchronous |/O (default)\nWrite requests, by default, are cached; that is, data is written tothe\nbuffer cache, not immediately to disk. This method generally gives the\nhighest throughput, in part because multiple writes to the same page\ncan be combined into one physical write to disk.

This method generally gives the\nhighest throughput, in part because multiple writes to the same page\ncan be combined into one physical write to disk. This not only decreases\ndisk traffic, but it increases the concurrent access of common data by\nmultiple threads and processes. In addition, delaying the write to disk\nincreases the likelihood that a page may be combined with contiguous\npages into a single, larger physical write, saving seek time and delays\ncaused by rotational latency.\nIf a crash occurs, the next time a fileset in the domain is mounted,\nthe completed log transactions are replayed to disk and incomplete\ntransactions are backed out so that the original data on disk is restored.\nThese log transactions, by default, save only metadata, not the data\nwritten tothe file. This means that file sizes and locations on disk will\nbe consistent but, depending on when the crash occurred, the data from\nrecent writes may be out of date. This is a trade-off for the increased\nthroughput gained using this method.\n4-4 Optimizing Performance\n\nAsynchronous atomic-write data logging I/O\nThis method is similar to asynchronous |/ O except that the data written\nto the buffer cache is also written to the log for each write request. This\nis done in 8-kilobyte increments. Eventually the data is also written to\nthe file, meaning that the data will be written to disk twice: once to\nthe log and then tothe file. The extra write of the data to the log may\ndegrade throughput compared with using asynchronous I/O.\nIf a crash occurs, the data is recovered from the log when the fileset\nis remounted. As is done in asynchronous I/O, all completed log\ntransactions are replayed and incomplete transactions are backed out.\nUnlike asynchronous I/O, however, the user’s data has been written to\nthe log, so both the metadata and the data intended for the file can be\nrestored. This guarantees that each 8-kilobyte increment of a write is\neither completely written to disk or not written.

To\nactivate data logging on a file that has a frag, append enough bytes to\nthe file to bring it up to the next 8-kilobyte boundary. For example, if\n£ileb had 6803 bytes, it would be stored in one 7-kilobyte frag. To\nactivate data logging, you would need to add 1389 bytes so the file would\nterminate on an 8-kilobyte boundary:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=fileb bs=1 seek=6803 count=1389 \\\nconv=notrunc\nFiles that use atomic-write data logging cannot be memory mapped\nthrough the mmap system call. See Section 5.2 for information on\nconflicting file usage.\nSynchronous |/O\nSynchronous I/O is similar to asynchronous I/O, but the data is written\nboth to the cache and to the disk before the write request returns to the\ncalling application. This means that if a write was successful, the data\nis guaranteed to be correct. The penalty for this is reduced throughput\nbecause the write will not return until after the |/O has completed. In\naddition, since the application, not the file system, determines when the\ndata needs to be flushed to disk, the likelihood of consolidating |/Os may\nbe reduced if synchronous write requests are small.\nOptimizing Performance 4-5\n\nTo turn synchronous |/O off and on, use the o_ SYNC or O_DSyYNc flag\nto the open() system call (see the Programmer's Guide).

See fent1(2) and the Programmer's\nGuide for more information.\n4.1.5 Improving Data Transfer Rate with Direct I/O\nYou can use direct |/O mode to synchronously read and write data from a\nfile without copying the data into a cache (the normal AdvFS process). That\nis, when direct I/O is enabled for a file, read and write requests on it are\nexecuted to and from disk storage through direct memory access (similar to\nraw I/O), bypassing AdvFS caching. This may improve the speed of the 1/O\nprocess for applications that access data only once.\nAlthough direct I/O will handle I/O requests of any byte size, the best\nperformance will occur when the requested transfer size is aligned on a disk\nsector boundary and the transfer size is an even multiple of the underlying\nsector size (currently 512 bytes).\nDirect I/O is particularly suited for files that are used exclusively by a\ndatabase. However, if an application tends to access data multiple times,\ndirect I/O can adversely impact performance because caching will not occur.\nAs soon as you specify direct I/O, it takes precedence and any data already in\nthe buffer cache for that file will automatically be flushed to disk.\nTo open a file for direct 1/O, use the open () function and specify the\nO DIRECTIO flag. For example, for file_ x enter:\nopen (filex , O DIRECTIO|O RDWR, 0644)\nIf the file is already open for direct I/O or is in cached mode, the new mode\nwill be direct |/O and will remain so until the last close of the file. Note that\ndirect I/O, atomic-write data logging, and mmapping are mutually exclusive\nmodes. Therefore, if the file is already open for atomic-write data logging or\niS mmapped, then calling the open function to initiate direct I/O will fail.\n4-6 Optimizing Performance\n\nThe fent1 () funct", "start_char": 159900, "end_char": 162100}

See fent1(2) and open(2) or the Programmer's\nGuide for more information.\n4.2 Monitoring Performance\nThere are a number of ways to gather performance information:\n« Theiostat utility reports I/O statistics for terminals, disks, and the\nCPU. It displays the number of transfers per second (tps) and bytes\nper second in kilobytes (bps). From this you can determine where |/O\nbottlenecks are occurring. That is, if one device shows sustained high\nthroughput, this device is being utilized more than others. Then you can\ndecide what action might increase throughput: moving files, obtaining\nfaster volumes, striping files, and so on. You can view I/O statistics with\nthe SysMan “View Input/Output (I/O) Statistics” or from the command\nline (See iostat(1)).\n« Theadvfsstat utility displays detailed information about the activity\nof filesets and domains over time. You can examine, for example, the\nactivity of the buffer cache, volume reads/writes, and the BMT record.\nSee advfsstat(8) for more information.\n¢ Collect for Tru64 UNIX gathers and displays information for subsystems\nsuch as memory, disk, tape, network or file systems.

However, as files\ngrow, contiguous blocks on the disk may not be available to accommodate\nthe new data, and the system will spread the file over discontiguous blocks.\nAs a result, the file is fragmented on the disk and consists of multiple file\nextents.

The balance utility moves files only to\noptimize distribution. For example, it might move many small files when\nmoving a single larger one would be a better solution for your system.\nChoose the migrate utility over the defragment utility when you want to\ndefragment an individual file. If you have a large enough contiguous area on\ndisk, you can migrate the file to that area to defragment it.\nYou can use the showfile -x command tolook at the extent map and the\nperformance percentage of a file. A low performance percentage (less than\n80%) indicates that the file is fragmented on the disk. The extent map shows\nwhether the entire file or a portion of the file is fragmented.\n4.3.3.2 Migrate Example\nThe following example displays the extent map of a file called src and\nmigrates the file.

This increases the\nsequential read/write performance because |/O requests to the different disk\ndrives can be overlapped. Virtual storage solutions, such as LSM, RAID,\nand storage area networks (SAN), stripe whole systems and are usually\nconfigured at system setup. AdvFS striping is applied to single files and\nis executed any time.\nUse AdvFS striping only on directly attached storage that does not include\nLSM, RAID, or a SAN.

This recovery keeps the\nAdvFS metadata consistent and makes use of the AdvF S transaction log file.\nDifferent versions of the operating system use different AdvFS log record\ntypes. Therefore, it is important that AdvFS recovery be done on the same\nversion of the operating system as was running at the time of the crash.\nFor example, if your system was running Version 5.1 when it crashed, do\nnot reboot using Version 3.2G because the log records may be formatted\ndifferently from those saved by the Version 5.1 system.\nTo reboot without error using a different version of the operating system,\ncleanly unmount all", "start_char": 191100, "end_char": 193300}

Note that if the system failed\nduetoa system panic or an AdvFS domain panic, it is best to reboot using the\noriginal version of the operating system and then run the verify command\nto ensurethat the domain is not corrupted. If it is not, it is then safeto reboot\nusing a different version of the operating system. If running the verify\ncommand indicates that the domain has been corrupted, see Section 5.4.6.\n5.2 Memory Mapping, Direct I/O and Data Logging\nIncompatibility\nMemory mapping, atomic-write data logging and direct |/O are mutually\nexclusive. If a file is open in one of these modes, attempting to open the\nsame file in one of the conflicting modes will fail. For more information see\nSection 4.1.4 and Section 4.1.5 and the mmap(2) reference page.\n5.3 Handling Poor Performance\nThe performance of a disk depends upon the 1/O demands upon it. If your\ndomain is structured so that heavy access is focused on one volume, it is\nlikely that system performance will degrade. Once you have determined\nthe load balance, there are a number of ways to equalize the activity and\nincrease throughput. See System Configuration and Tuning, command\nreference pages, and Chapter 4 for more complete information.\n5-2 Troubleshooting\n\nTo discover the causes of poor performance, first check system activity (see\nSection 4.2). There are a number of ways to improve performance:\nUpgrade domains\nDVN4 domains are indexed when a directory grows beyond a page, that\nis, about 200 files (see Section 1.4.3.2). Directories with more than 5000\nfiles show the most benefit.\nEliminate disk access incompatibility\nIf you have initiated direct I/O (which turns off caching) to read and\nwrite data toa file, any application that accesses the same file will also\nhave direct I/O. This may prove inefficient (see Section 4.1.5 ).\nDefragment domains\nAs files grow, contiguous space on disk often is not available to\naccommodate new data, so file", "start_char": 193050, "end_char": 195250}

This may prove inefficient (see Section 4.1.5 ).\nDefragment domains\nAs files grow, contiguous space on disk often is not available to\naccommodate new data, so files become fragmented. F ile fragmentation\ncan reduce system performance because more I/O is required to read or\nwrite a file. Usethe AdvFS GUI (See Chapter 6) or run the defragment\nutility from the command line (see Section 4.3.1).\nIf you have AdvFS Utilities, you can also:\nBalance a multivolume domain\nSystem performance improves if you distribute files evenly over all\nyour volumes. Files that are distributed unevenly can degrade system\nperformance. Use the balance command to redistribute the files (see\nSection 4.3.2).\nWhen a volume is added to a domain with the addvol command, all the\nfiles of the domain remain on the previously existing volume and the\nnew one is empty. To even the file distribution, use the AdvFS GUI (see\nChapter 6) or run the balance utility from the command line.\nStripe individual files\nAdvFS allows you to stripe individual files across multiple volumes (See\nSection 4.3.4). Use AdvFS striping only on directly attached storage that\nis not otherwise striped. Combining AdvFS striping with other striping\nmay degrade performance.\nMigrate individual files\nYou can use the migrate utility to move a heavily accessed file or\nselected pages of a file to another volume in the domain. You can\nmove the file to a specific volume or you can let the system choose (see\nSection 4.3.3).\nTroubleshooting 5-3\n\n« Change AdvFS resources\nYou can change your file system size in the following ways:\n- Increase the size of a domain by adding a volume with the addvol\ncommand (see Section 1.4.6). For optimum performance, each volume\nyou add should consist of the entire disk (typically, partition c). Do\nnot add a volume containing any data you want to keep. When you\nrun the addvol command, data on the added disk is destroyed.\n- Shrink a domain by removing a volume with the rmvol command (see\nSection 1.4.7). Striped file segments will be moved to a volume that\ndoes not contain a stripe. If this is not possible, the system requests", "start_char": 195000, "end_char": 197200}

Striped file segments will be moved to a volume that\ndoes not contain a stripe. If this is not possible, the system requests\nconfirmation before doubling up on stripes (see Section 4.3.4).\nYou can interrupt the rmvol process with Cirl/c without damaging\nyour domain. Files already removed from the volume will remain in\ntheir new location. Files that had not been moved at the time of the\ninterrupt will remain in their original location.\nIf the volume that has had the files removed does not allow new\nfile allocations after an aborted rmvol operation, use the chvol\ncommand with the -A option to reactivate the volume.\n- Change the size of a domain by changing volumes. Add a new one,\nmove your files to it, then remove the old (see Section 4.3.3).\n5.4 Handling Disk Problems\nBack up your data regularly and frequently and watch for signs of\nimpending disk failure. Removing files from a problem disk before it fails\ncan prevent a lot of trouble. See the Event Management information in\nSystem Administration for more information.\n5.4.1 Checking Free Space and Disk Usage\nYou can look at the way space is allocated on a disk by file, fileset, or domain.\nThe AdvFS GUI (see Chapter 6) displays a hierarchical view of disk objects\nand the space they use. Table 5-1 shows command-line commands that\nexamine disk space usage.\nTable 5-1: Disk Space Usage Information Commands\nCommand Description\ndu Displays information about block allocation for files; use\nthe -a option to display information for individual files.\ndt Displays disk space usage by fileset; available space for\na fileset is limited by the fileset quota if it is set.\n5-4 Troubleshooting\n\nTable 5-1: Disk Space Usage Information Commands (cont.)\nshowfdmn Displays the attributes and block usage for each\nvolume in an active domain; for multivolume domains,\nadditional volume information is displayed.\nshowfile Displays block usage and volume information for a\nfile or for the contents of a directory.\nshowfsets Displays information about the filesets in a domain;\nuse to display fileset quota limits.\nvat Displa", "start_char": 196950, "end_char": 199150}

To correct this, change the entry in the /etc/fstab file to enable\nthe quotacheck command torun. The quotacheck command only checks\nfilesets that have the userquota and groupquota options specified. For\nexample, for the fileset usr_domain#usr:\nusr domain#usr /usr advfs rw,userquota,groupquota 0 2\nThen run the quotacheck command for the fileset:\n# quotacheck usr _domain#usr\nThis should correct the disk usage information.\n5.4.2 Reusing AdvFS Volumes\nAll volumes (disks, disk partitions, LSM volumes, etc.) are labeled either\nunused or with the file system for which they were last used. You can only\nadd a volume labeled unused to your domain (See Section 1.3).\nIf the volume you wish to add is part of an existing domain (the /etc/fdmns\ndirectory entry exists), the easiest way to return the volume label to unused\nstatus is to remove the volume with the rmvol command or to remove the\ndomain with the rm£dmn command (which labels all volumes that were in\nthe domain unused).\nFor example, if your volumeis /dev/disk/dsk5c, your original domain is\nold_domain, and the domain you want toadd the volume tois new_domain,\nmount all the filesets in old_domain then enter:\n# rmvol /dev/disk/dsk5c old domain\n# addvol /dev/disk/dsk5c new domain\nIf the volume you want to add is not part of an existing domain but is giving\nyou a warning message because it is labeled, reset the disk label. If you\nTroubleshooting 5-5\n\nanswer yes tothe prompt on the addvol or mkfdmn command, the disk\nlabel will be reset. You will lose all information that was on the volume\nthat you are adding.\n5.4.3 Dumping to Block 0\nTo dump to a partition that starts at block O of a disk, you must first clear\nthe disk label.

If you do not, the vdump command may appear to contain\nvalid savesets, but when the vrestore command attempts to interpret the\ndisk label as part of the saveset, it will return an error (See Section 3.1.5).\n5.4.4 Disk Space Usage Limits\nIf your system has been running without any limits on resource usage, you\ncan add quotas to limit the amount of disk space your users can access.\nAdvFS quotas provide a layer of control beyond that available with UFS.\nUser and group quotas limit the amount of space a user or group can\nallocate for a fileset. Fileset quotas restrain a fileset from grabbing all of the\navailable space in a domain.\nYou can set two types of quota limits: hard limits that cannot be exceeded\nand soft limits that can be exceeded for a period of time called the grace\nperiod. You can turn quota enforcement on and off. See Chapter 2 for\ncomplete information.\nIf you are working in an editor and realize that the information you need\nto save will put you over your quota limit, do not abort the editor or write\nthe file because data may be lost. Instead, remove files to make room for the\nedited file prior to writing it. You can also write the file to another fileset,\nsuch as tmp, remove files from the fileset whose quota you exceeded, and\nthen move the file back to that fileset.\nAdvFS will impose quota limits in the rare case that you are 8 kilobytes\nbelow the user, group, or fileset quota and are attempting to use some or all\nof the space you have left. This is because AdvFS allocates storage in units\nof 8 kilobytes. If adding 8 kilobytes to a file would exceed the quota limit,\nthen that file cannot be extended.\n5.4.5 Verifying File System Consistency\nTo ensure that metadata is consistent, run the verify command to verify\nthe file system structure. This utility checks disk structures such as the\nbitfile metadata table (BMT), the storage bitmaps, the tag directory, and the\nfrag file for each fileset. It verifies that the directory structure is correct,\nthat", "start_char": 200850, "end_char": 203050}

You must be the root user to run this command.\n5-6 Troubleshooting\n\nIt is a good idea to run the verify command:\n¢ When problems are evident (corruptions, domain panic, lost data, I/O\nerrors).\n¢ Before an update installation.\ne If your files have not been accessed in three to six months or longer\nand you plan torun utilities such as balance, defragment, migrate,\nquotacheck, repquota, rmfset, rmvol, Or vdump that access every\nfile in a domain.\nUse the SysMan “Repair an AdvFS Domain” or, from the command line,\nenter:\nverify domain_name\nThe verify command mounts filesets in special directories as it proceeds.\nIf the command is unable to mount a fileset due to the failure of a domain,\nas a last resort run the command with the -F option. This option mounts\nthe fileset using the -d option of the mount command, which means that\nAdvF$S initializes the transaction log for the domain without recovery. As\nno domain recovery will occur for previously incomplete operations, this\ncould cause data corruption.\nUnder some circumstances the verify command may fail to unmount the\nfilesets. If this occurs, you must unmount the affected filesets manually.\nOn machines with many millions of files, sufficient swap must be allocated\nfor the verify utility torun to completion. If the amount of memory required\nby verify exceeds the kernel variable proc/max_ per proc data size\nprocess variable, the utility will not complete. To overcome this problem,\nallocate up to 10% of the domain size in swap for running the verify\ncommand.\nThe following example verifies the domainx domain, which contains the\nfilesets setx and sety:\n# verify domainx\n+++Domain verification+++\nDomain Id 2£03b70a.000f1db0\nChecking disks\nChecking storage allocated on disk /dev/disk/dsk10g\nChecking storage allocated on disk /dev/disk/dsk1l0a\nChecking mcell list\nChecking mcell position field\nCh", "start_char": 202800, "end_char": 205000}

Pick the simplest recovery path for the information you have.\n1. Runtheverify utility totry torepair the domain (see Section 5.4.5 and\nverify(8)). The verify utility can only fix a limited set of problems.\nRecreate the domain from your most recent backup.\nIf your backup is not recent enough, use your most recent backup with\nthe salvage utility to obtain more current copies of files.\nThe amount of data you are able to recover will depend upon the damage\nto your domain. You must be root user to run the salvage utility. See\nsalvage(8) for more information.\nUse the SysMan “Recover Files from an AdvFS Domain” or, from the\ncommand line, enter:\nsalvage domain _name\nRunning the salvage utility does not guarantee that you will recover all\nof your domain. You may be missing files, directories, file names, or parts\nof files. The utility generates a log file that contains the status of files that\nwere recovered. Use the -1 option to list in the log file the status of all files\nthat are encountered.\nThe salvage utility places recovered files in directories named after the\nfilesets. There is a lost+found directory for each fileset that contains files\nfor which no parent directory can be found. You can specify the path name of\n5-8 Troubleshooting\n\nthe directory that is to contain the fileset directories", "start_char": 204750, "end_char": 206950}

If you do not specify\na directory, the utility writes recovered filesets under the current working\ndirectory. You cannot mount the directories in which the files are recovered.\nYou must move the recovered files to new filesets.\nThe best way to recover your domain is to use your daily backup tapes. If\nfiles have changed since the last backup, you can use the tapes along with\nthe salvage utility as follows:\n1. Create a new domain and filesets to hold the recovered information.\nMount the filesets.\nRestore from your backup tape(s) to the new domain.\nRun the salvage utility with the -d option set to recover files that\nhave changed since the backup. If you have no backups, you can run\nthe salvage utility without the -d option to recover all the files in\nthe domain.\nThe fastest salvage process is to recover file information to another location\non disk. The following example recovers data to disk:\n# /sbin/advfs/salvage -d 199812071330 corrupt3 domain\nsalvage: Domain to be recovered ‘corrupt3_ domain’\nsalvage: Volume(s) to be used '/dev/disk/dskl2a’\n'/dev/disk/dsk12g’ '/dev/disk/dsk12h’\nsalvage: Files will be restored to ’.’\nsalvage: Logfile will be placed in './salvage.log’\nsalvage: Starting search of all filesets:\n09-Mar-2000 11:53:40\nsalvage: Starting search of all volumes:\n09-Mar-2000 11:55:41\nsalvage: Loading file names for all filesets:\n09-Mar-2000 11:56:42\nsalvage: Starting recovery of all filesets:\n09-Mar-2000 11:57:02\nIf not enough room is available on disk for the recovered information, you\ncan recover data to tape and then write it back on to your original disk\nlocation.

Although\nthe domain cannot be accessed, the filesets in the domain can be unmounted.\nWhen a domain panic occurs, an EvM event is logged (see EVM(5)) and the\nfollowing message is printed to the system log and the console:\nAdvFS Domain Panic; Domain name Id domainId\nFor example:\nAdvFS Domain Panic; Domain staffb domain Id 2dad7c28.0000dfbb\nAn AdvFS domain panic has occurred due to either a\nmetadata write error or an internal inconsistency.\nThis domain is being rendered inaccessible.\nBy default, a domain panic on an active domain will cause a live dump to be\ncreated and placed in the /var/adm/crash directory. Please file a problem\nreport with your software support organization and include the dump file\nand a copy of the running kernel.\nTo recover from a domain panic, perform the following steps:\n1. Runthemount command with the -t option and identify all mounted\nfilesets in the affected domain.\n5-12 Troubleshooting\n\nUnmount all these filesets.\nExamine the /etc/fdmns directory to obtain a list of the AdvFS\nvolumes in the domain that panicked.\n4.

These saved files will be written in the directory\nspecified and contain information that technical support needs.\n5.

The size recorded in the domain’s metadata for each volume\nmust match the size of the volume. If the sizes match, the mount proceeds.\nIf a volume is smaller than the recorded size, AdvFS attempts to read the\nlast block marked in use for the fileset. If this block can be read, the mount\nwill succeed, but the fileset will be marked as read-only. If the last in-use\nblock for any volume in the domain cannot be read, the mount will fail.\nSee mount (8) for more information.\nIf a fileset is mounted read-only, check the labels of the flagged volumes in\nthe error message. There are two common errors:\n¢ A disk is mislabeled on a RAID array.\ne AnLSM volume upon which an AdvFS domain resides has been shrunk\nfrom its original size (see Section 1.7).\nIf", "start_char": 214500, "end_char": 216700}

A missing or damaged /etc/fdmns directory prevents\naccess to a domain, but the data within the domain remains intact. You can\nrestore the /etc/fdmns directory from backup or you can recreate it.\nIf you have a current backup copy of the directory, it is preferable to restore\nthe /etc/fdmns directory from backup. Any standard backup facility\n(vdump, tar, Of cpio) can back up the /etc/fdmns directory. To restore the\ndirectory, use the recovery procedure that is compatible with your backup\nprocess.\nTroubleshooting 5-15\n\nYou can reconstruct the /etc/fdmns directory manually or with the\nadvscan command. The procedure for reconstructing the /etc/fdmns\ndirectory is similar for both single-volume and multivolume domains. You\ncan construct the directory for a missing domain, missing links, or the\nwhole directory.\nIf you choose to reconstruct the directory manually, you must know the name\nof each domain and its associated volumes.\n5.5.1.1. Reconstructing the /etc/fdmns Directory Manually\nIf you accidentally lose all or part of your /etc/fdmns directory, and you\nknow which domains and links are missing, you can reconstruct it manually.\nThe following example reconstructs the /etc/fdmns directory and two\ndomains where the domains exist and their names are known. Each contains\na single volume (or special device). Note that the order of creating the links\nin these examples does not matter. The domains are:\ndomon a/deiv/dnisk/idsk ic\ndomon a/deiv/dnisk/2dsk 2c\nTo reconstruct the two single-volume domains, enter:\nmkdir /etc/fdmns\nmkdir /etc/fdmns/domainl\ncd /etc/fdmns/domainl\nln -s /dev/disk/dsklc dsklc\nmkdir /etc/fdmns/domain2\ncd /etc/fdmns/domain2\nSGttSGtEEehhEE ln -s /dev/di", "start_char": 218400, "end_char": 220600}

This command is useful:\nWhen disks have moved to a new system, device numbers have changed,\nor you have lost track of a domain location.\nFor repair, if you delete the /etc/fdmns directory, delete a domain from\nthe /etc/fdmns directory, or delete links from a domain’s subdirectory\nin the /etc/fdmns directory.\nThe advscan command can:\nDetermine if a partition is an AdvFS partition.\nList partitions in the order they are found on disk.\nRead the disk label to determine which partitions are in the domain\nand if any are overlapping.\nScan all disks found in any /etc/fdmns domain.\nRecreate missing domain directories.

So the directory\ncontaining the license database must be recovered from the usr fileset\nbefore the addvol command can be accessed. On some systems the /var\ndirectory is in a separate fileset. If this is the case, the addvol command\ncan be recovered first and then can be used to add the volumes.\nThe following example restores a multivolume domain where the /var\ndirectory and the /usr directory are both in the usr fileset in the\nusr_domain domain consisting of the dsklg, dsk2c, and dsk3c volumes.\nThe procedure assumes that the root file system has already been restored.\n1.

You must be root user to run\nthis command (see savemeta(8)).\nTroubleshooting 5-25\n\n5.6.2 Physically Moving an AdvFS Disk\nIf a machine has failed, it is possible to move disks containing AdvFS\ndomains to another computer running AdvFS. Connect the disk(s) to the\nnew machine and modify the /etc/fdmns directory so the new system will\nrecognize the transferred volume(s). You must be root user to complete this\nprocess.\nYou cannot move domains that have a DVN of 4 to systems running a\nVersion 4 operating system. Doing so will generate an error message (see\nSection 5.1). You can move domains with a DVN of 3 toa machine running\nVersion 5. The newer operating system will recognize the domains created\nearlier.\nCaution\nDo not use either the addvol command or the mk£dmn command\nto add the volumes to the new machine. Doing so will delete all\ndata on the disk you are moving. See Section 5.4.6 if you have\nalready done so.\nIf you do not know what partitions your domains were on, you can add the\ndisks on the new machine and run the advscan command, which may be\nable to recreate this information. You can also look at the disk label on\nthe disk to see which partitions in the past have been made into AdvFS\npartitions. This will not tell you which partitions belong to which domains.\nFor example, if the motherboard of your machine fails, you need to move\nthe disks to another system. You may need to reassign the disk SCSI\n|Ds to avoid conflicts. (See your disk manufacturer instructions for more\ninformation.) For this example, assume the! Ds are assigned to disks 6 and\n8. Assume also that the system has a domain, testing domain, on two\ndisks, dsk3 and dsk4. This domain contains two filesets: samplel_ fset\nand sample2_fset.

Use this name to set up symbolic links\nin step 5 below.\n5. Modify your /etc/fdmns directory to include the information from\nthe transferred domains:\nmkdir -p /etc/fdmns/testdiomnagin\ncd /etc/fdmns/testdiomnagin\nIn -s /dev/disk/dsk6éc dské6c\nIn -s /dev/disk/dsk8a dsk8a\nIn -s /dev/disk/dsk8b dsk8b\nln -s /dev/disk/dsk8g dsk8g\nmkdir /data/samplel\nHHOOOOHHHHhO oHm kdir /data/sample2\n6.

The GUI is\ndesigned to run under the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). You can\nuse the GUI as a remote manager to monitor your system or to search\nfor available volumes. The GUI does not exactly duplicate the file system\nmanagement tasks available from the command line. Rather, it allows\nyou to visualize your file system structure and perform the most common\noperations on volumes, domains, filesets, and clones.\nTo access this utility, you must register the AdvFS Utilities license and you\nmust have root-user privilege. For information about license activation see\nLicense Registration .\n6.1 Installing the GUI\nTo load the GUI, choose the AdvFS Utilities subset when you update or\ninstall the Version 5.0 operating system.\nTable 6-1 contains the subset titles, names (where xxx is the subset\nidentification number), and descriptions of the subsets that make up the\nAdvFS GUI.

The agent must be running for the GUI to operate.\n6.2.1 GUI Agent (advfsd)\nThe AdvFS GUI agent issues commands and obtains system information\nfor the GUI. The agent is automatically started at boot time and when the\nOSFADVFSDAEMON subset is installed. It runs unseen in the background.\nUnder normal conditions, advfsd does not need to be run manually. If you\nwant to start or stop the agent at any time, do so from the command line\n(see advfsd(8)).\nOnly oneagent can berunning on a system at a given time. If you attempt to\nstart a second copy of advfsd, it will fail.\nThe agent allows Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) clients\nsuch as NetView®t o request AdvFS information.

The interval is\nsaved between restarts of the agent.\n6.2.2 GUI (dtadvfs)\nOnly the root user can start dtadvfs. It can bestarted in a terminal window\nor from a CDE icon. The file system operations that the GUI can perform\nare described in Section 6.4.\nTo start the GUI from the command line, type:\n# /usr/bin/X11/dtadvfs &\nTo start the GUI using Common Desktop Environment (CDE) icons:\n1.

Doubleclick the Storage Management icon in the System_Admin\nwindow.\n4. Double-click the Advanced File System icon in the Storage Management\nwindow.\nWhen the GUI is running, window displays are periodically updated to\nreflect the changing characteristics of the file system. The GUI refresh\ninterval, the time interval between updates, is 15 minutes by default. To\nchange the GUI refresh interval when the GUI is running, see Section 6.3.1.\nThe GUI refresh interval is not saved between restarts of the GUI.\n6.2.2.1. GUI Security\nEach Tru64 UNIX system that the GUI will manage has two optional\nsecurity files associated with it: a password file and a file of allowable hosts.\nThe password file restricts the use of the GUI managing a particular system\nto administrators who know the password. The allowable hosts file allows\nonly GUIs running on systems listed in the file to remotely manage it.\nThese files are configured through an editor of your choice. They cannot\nbe accessed directly from the GUI.\nThe root user creates the password file, /var/advfs/dae-\nmon/socket/gui. passwd, on the system for which the password is to be\nused.

If you have\nprotected your system with a password in the system's gui . passwd file,\nremote users will also have to know that password.\nSee advfsd(8) and dtadv£fs(8) for more information.\n6.2.2.2 Ignoring Disks\nCreate the /var/advfs/daemon/disks.ignore file to specify a list of\ndisks that the agent will not examine. The disks. ignore file contains\na plain-text list of disk drives, one per line. This file is useful because\nperformance may be reduced when there are off-line HSZ devices or\nspun-down disk drives.\nSince the agent processes the disks. ignore file every time the disks are\nchecked, disks that fail can be added to the file and disks listed in the file\nthat become available can be removed. It is not necessary to stop the agent.\nSee advfsd(8) for more information.\nYou cannot ignore an LSM volume by including the LSM volume name in the\ndisks .ignore file; you must list the disks from which the LSM volume is\nbuilt.

It is a good idea to periodically check these files.\nBoth the agent and the GUI log files are periodically renamed to prevent\nunrestricted consumption of disk space.\n6.2.2.4 Help\nThe help system contains background information about the AdvFS file\nsystem as well as specific information about the GUI.

You can attach to these systems\nthrough the GUI:\nChoose Host... from the AdvFS menu of the Main window.\nThe Select a Host dialog box appears in which you can select another\nhost system or choose to modify the host list to add or delete host\nsystems. This list is created by you and saved on your system to identify\nthe hosts you connect to regularly.\n3.

You cannot balance a domain while you\nare defragmenting, adding or removing volumes, or removing filesets on the\nsame domain. You can choose to abort the operation at any time.

Also included are instructions\nfor converting your entire system from AdvFS to UFS.\nThe methods provided here are guidelines; that is, they are suggestions that\nillustrate the process of conversion. Specific file names, tape drives, and disk\npartitions depend on your system.\nThe vdump and vrestore file formats are compatible for Version 4 and\nVersion 5.0 operating systems. If you upgrade to Version 5.0, recreate the\ndomains, and restore the data from backup (see Chapter 3), your AdvFS\nfilesets and domains will have the updated structure (See Section 1.4.3).\nC.1 Converting a /usr File System to AdvFS\nDuring the initial installation of AdvFS, you can install /usr on AdvFS.\nConverting the /usr (UFS) file system to AdvFS reduces the amount of\ntime your system is down after a system failure.

Books with index entries in\nthe Master Index are listed in Table 1.\nAudience\nThis book is for anyone who needs to access information about the Tru64\nUNIX operating system. It can help you find a specific topic in the\ndocumentation set by pointing you to the location in the book where the\ntopic is discussed.\nNew and Changed Features\nBeginning with this release, you can search the HTML version of the Master\nIndex using a keyword search. To open the keyword search page, click on the\n“Search the Master Index” subentry under Master Index in the General User\nDocuments list in the Online Documentation Library.\nTo perform a keyword search, enter the word or phrase you want tofind. The\nsearch function searches the entire Master Index for matches, and displays\nthe results. When you click on an entry in the search results, the target book\nopens in its own window. In most cases, the book opens to the place in the\ntext that is indicated by the entry.\nConventions\nIn the printed and PDF versions of the Master Index, each master index\npage reference is preceded by an abbreviated book title. For example, the\nfollowing entry points to page 3-2 in the book Sharing Software on a Local\nArea Network:\ninstallation\nRIS software subset, SharingSW 3-2\nTable 1 maps the abbreviated title for each book to its complete book title.\nThe HTML version of the Master Index does not contain page numbers.\nInstead, the abbreviated book title appears as a hot link. Clicking on this\nlink takes you either to the beginning of the book being referenced or, in\nmany cases, to the actual location of the information in the book. Most\nentries also provide section numbers, to help you further refine your search.\nAbout This Manual iii\n\nTable 1: Book Title Abbreviations\nAbbreviation Book Title\nAdvF SAdmin AdvFS Administration\nAsmLangGde Assembly Language Programmer's Guide\nAsynchronousT M Asynchronous Transfer Mode\nCallingStandard Calling Standard for Alpha Systens\nCDE Companion CDE Companion\nCLangRef Compaq C Language Reference Manual\nClusTechOver TruCl", "start_char": 1950, "end_char": 4150}

In\nsystem terms, internationalization refers to the provision of interfaces that\nlet programs produce varying output, depending on the specific environment\nin which they are run. The mnemonic 118N is frequently used as an\nabbreviation for internationalization.\nThis manual describes Tru64 UNIX interfaces and utilities that help\nyou develop internationalized programs. These interfaces and utilities\nconform to specifications in the X/Open UNIX standard, which allows for\nimplementation-defined behavior in certain areas. This manual identifies\nthose software characteristics that are specific to the Tru64 UNIX operating\nsystem.\n1.1 Language\nAn internationalized program makes no assumptions about the language of\ncharacter data (text) that the program is designed to handle. The term data\nrefers to data generated internally, data extracted from or written to files,\nand message text used for communication with the program’s user.\nLanguage has implications f", "start_char": 35100, "end_char": 37300}

The term data\nrefers to data generated internally, data extracted from or written to files,\nand message text used for communication with the program’s user.\nLanguage has implications for processing text for such things as character\nhandling and word ordering. Tru64 UNIX provides interfaces that allow\ninternationalized programs to manipulate text according to the language\nrequirements of individual users.\nLanguage differences require the separation of message text from program\ncode. Tru64 UNIX provides facilities that allow message text to be separated\nfrom the code, translated into different languages, and accessed by the\nprogram at run time. Chapter 3 explains how an internationalized program\nthat uses the Worldwide Portability Interfaces (WPI) generates and accesses\nmessages.\nAn internationalized program that uses X and Motif interfaces can separate\nmessage text from program code in the following ways:\n¢ By defining menu items, titles, text fields, and messages in UIL (User\nInterface Language) files\nIntroduction 1-1\n\n¢ By Specifying titles and font lists in application resource files\n¢ By specifying help messages in files that the Help widget uses\nFor information about separating message text from program code for X and\nMotif interfaces, refer to the following books:\n¢« X Window Systen Toolkit\n¢ OSF/ Motif Programmer's Guide\n« Common Desktop Environment: Internationalization Programmer's\nGuide\n1.2 Cultural Data\nCultural data refers to the conventions of a geographic area or territory for\nsuch things as date, time, and currency formats.\nAn internationalized program cannot assume how these formats are set\nin advance and uses system facilities to determine formats at run time.\nThis capability is provided through a language information database that\nprograms can query for the required formats of cultural data items.\n1.3 Character Sets\nA character set is a set of alphabetic or other characters used to construct\nthe words and other elementary units of a native language or computer\nlanguage.

A coded character set (or codeset) is a set of unambiguous rules\nthat establishes a character set and the one-to-one relationship between\neach character of the set and its bit representation.\nFor a program to be able to handle text recorded in different codesets, the\nprogram cannot make assumptions about the size or bit assignment of\ncharacter encodings. In particular, the program cannot assume that any\npart of an area used to store a character is available for other uses.\n1.4 Localization\nLocalization refers to the process of implementing local requirements within\na computer system. Some of these requirements are addressed by locales.\nEach locale is a set of data that supports a particular combination of native\nlanguage, cultural data, and codeset. The type of information a locale can\ncontain and the interfaces that use a locale are subject to standardization.\nHowever, where locales reside on the system and how they are named can\nvary from one vendor to another.\nThereis more to localization than providing locales. For example, the\nlocalization process means making sure that translations are available\n1-2 Introduction\n\nfor software messages; appropriate fonts, and measurement systems are\nsupported and available for display and printing devices; and, in some cases,\nadditional software is written to handle local requirements.\nThe mnemonic LON is frequently used as an abbreviation for localization.\n1.4.1 Collating Sequence\nThe ordering of characters may be implicit in underlying hardware but can\nbe defined for software to conform to the way language is used in a particular\nterritory. Many languages have more complex rules for sorting than English.\nThef ollowing list describes some collating rules that do not exist for English:\n¢ A singleletter is not necessarily represented by a single character. In\ntraditional Spanish, for example, the character combination ch sorts\nbetween the characters c and d.\ne« A single character can be equivalent to a combined set of characters.\nFor example, the & character is equivalent to ss in standard", "start_char": 39000, "end_char": 41200}

In\ntraditional Spanish, for example, the character combination ch sorts\nbetween the characters c and d.\ne« A single character can be equivalent to a combined set of characters.\nFor example, the & character is equivalent to ss in standard and Swiss\nGerman and to sz in Austrian German.\ne Accented letters do not always follow unaccented letters. In many\nlanguages, this is true only if the words that contain those letters are\notherwise identical. In other languages, a particular accented letter\nmay be considered unique and sort after a letter that is different from\nthe unaccented counterpart.\ne Characters can be sorted in multiple ways for the same language. The\nideographic characters in Asian languages have sort orders based on\npronunciation and on two visually recognized components (radicals,\nwhich are pictograms for elements of meaning, and the number of\nstrokes).\nEach locale contains information about collating sequences that informs\nstring comparison functions about the relative ordering of characters defined\nin the associated codeset. I nternationalized regular expressions also use the\ncollating sequence for implementing character ranges, collating symbols,\nand equivalence classes.\n1.4.2 Character Classification\nCharacter classification information describes the characteristics associated\nwith each valid character code; that is, whether the code defines an\nalphabetic, uppercase, lowercase, punctuation, control, space, or other kind\nof character. Character classification functions and internationalized regular\nexpressions use this information to determine character classes.\nIntroduction 1-3\n\n1.4.3 Case Conversion\nCase conversion refers to information that identifies the possible alternative\ncase of each valid character code. Case conversion functions use this\ninformation to change characters from uppercase to lowercase or from\nlowercase to uppercase. Note that case is not a characteristic of all of the\nletters, or even of any characters, in some languages.\n1.4.4 Language Information\nLanguage information (or langinfo database) refers to localization data\nthat describes the format and setting of cultural data that can vary from one\nlocale to another.", "start_char": 40950, "end_char": 43150}

This information includes the appropriate formats and\ncharacters for date and time, currency, and numeric values.\n1.4.5 Message Catalogs\nA message catalog is a file or storage area that contains program messages,\ncommand prompts, and responses to prompts for a particular language.\nMotif applications also use resource files and UIL files in addition to or in\nplace of message catalogs for text and other values that can vary from one\nlocale to another. Chapter 3 describes the messaging system.\n1.5 Language Announcement\nLanguage announcement is the mechanism by which language, cultural\ndata, and codeset requirements are set either for the system as a whole, by\nan application, or by individual users. Language announcement is performed\nby setting a locale namein a set of reserved environment variables. System\nmanagers can set the default values for these variables for different shell\nenvironments; refer to the System Administration book for information\nabout setting locale defaults for shells. Users can also set locale variables\non a per-process basis.\nTypically, internationalized programs read locale variables at run time and\nuse them to attach settings to locale categories in the programs’ operational\nenvironment. However, programs can also set these categories internally\nwhen appropriate. Therefore, the binding to a particular locale need not be\ngeneral for all parts of a program. Within one execution cycle, different parts\nof the program can request different localizations.\n1.6 Terms and Definitions\nThis section defines terms used extensively in this guide. Less common\nterms are defined when they first appear.\n1-4 Introduction\n\n1.6.1 Characters and Strings\nA character is a sequence of one or more bytes that represent a single\ngraphic symbol or control code.

Do not confuse the term character with\nthe C programming language char data type, which represents an object\nlarge enough to store any member of the basic execution character set and\nwhich is usually mapped as an 8-bit value. Unlike the char data typein C,\na character can be represented by a value that is one or more bytes. The\nexpression multibyte character is synonymous with the term character;\nthat is, both refer to character values of any length, including single-byte\nvalues.\nA character string or string is a contiguous sequence of bytes terminated\nby and including the null byte. A string is an array of type char in the C\nprogramming language. The null byte is a value with all bits set to zero (0).\nA wide character is an integral type that is large enough to hold any\nmember of the extended execution character set. In program terms, a\nwide character is an object of type wchar_t, which is defined in the\nheader files /usr/include/stddef .h (for conformance to the X/Open\nXSH specification) and /usr/include/stdlib.h (for conformance to the\nANSI C standard). The file locations where this data type is defined are\ndetermined by standards organizations; however, the definition itself is\nimplementation specific. For example, implementations that support only\nsingle-byte codesets (not the case for Tru64 UNIX) might define wchar_t\nas a byte value.\nA wide-character string is a contiguous sequence of wide characters\nterminated by and including the null wide character. A wide-character\nstring is an array of type wchar_t. Thenull wide character is awchar_t\nvalue with all bits set to zero (0).\nAn empty string is a character string whose first element is the null byte.\nSimilarly, an empty wide-character string is a wide-character string\nwhose first element is the null wide character.\n1.6.2 Portable Character Set\nThe Portable Character Set (PCS) is supported in both compile-time (Source)\nand run-time (executable) environments for all locales.

In such cases, the substituted character\nhas the same syntactic meaning as the character it replaces in the PCS. An\nexample of a character substitution might be the British pound sign (£) for\nthe number sign (# that is the default.\nThe definition of a character set that is portable across all codesets is\nparticularly relevant to encoding formats that support a limited set of\nnative languages. This is typical for most of the character encoding formats\ndeveloped for UNIX systems. In other words, the codeset used for a Chinese\nlocale must include all the PCS characters in addition to characters that are\npart of the Chinese language. However, that same codeset probably would\nnot include characters needed to support Russian or Icelandic. Similarly,\nthe codeset used for the Russian language probably would not include any\nChinese characters but must include all the PCS characters. Therefore, no\nmatter what the locale setting, programs can assume that characters in\nthe PCS are available.\n1.6.3 The Universal Character Set\nThe Universal Character Set (UCS) was developed to support all characters\nin all native languages.

The first implementation\nof this character enoding format, widely known as Unicode, was limited\nto the 16-bit values supported by early PC systems. However, current\nstandards (ISO/IEC 10646 and the Unicode Standard) specify a 32-bit\n(UCS-4) encoding format that expands the number of characters that can be\nsupported and is more efficiently manipulated as internal process code on\nlarger computer systems. The standards also define a number of universal\n1-6 Introduction\n\ntransformation formats (UTFs) used by the byte-oriented protocols that\nhandle file data.\nThe operating system supports various UCS encoding formats through a set\nof locales and codeset converters. The locales and some library functions\nallow applications to use UCS-4 as internal process code. The codeset\nconverters allow file data to be converted to encoding formats supported by\nfonts and other software resident on the system.\nSee Section 2.1 for more information about Unicode and related encoding\nformats.\nIntroduction 1-7\n\n2\nDeveloping Internationalized Software\nThis chapter explains how language, codeset, and cultural differences\nchange the way you implement basic coding operations.

In commercial situations, it is important that such\ninteractions take place in the native language of each user. Cultural data\nshould also observe the correct customs.\nWhen you write programs to support multilanguage operation, you must\nconsider the fact that languages can be represented within the computer\nsystem by one or more codesets. Because of the requirements of different\nlanguages, characters in codesets may vary in both size (8-bit, 16-bit, and so\non) and binary representation.\nYou can satisfy the preceding requirements by writing programs that make\nno hard-coded assumptions about language, cultural data, or character\nencodings. Such programs are said to be internationalized. Data specific\nto each supported language, territory, and codeset combination are held\nseparately from the program code and can be bound to the run-time\nenvironment by language-initialization functions.\nTru64 UNIX provides the following facilities for developing internationalized\nsoftware, defining localization data, and announcing specific language\nrequirements:\ne Library functions that handle extended character codes and that\nprovide language- and codeset-independent character classification, case\nconversion, number format conversion, and string collation\ne Library functions that let programs dynamically determine cultural\nand language-specific data\nDeveloping Internationalized Software 2-1\n\n« A message system that allows program messages to be held apart from\nthe program code, translated into different languages, and retrieved\nby a program at run time\n¢ An initialization function that binds a program at run time to the\nlinguistic and cultural requirements of each user\nThe rest of this chapter describes each of these facilities in more detail.\nThe discussion and examples in this chapter focus on functions provided in\nthe Standard C Library.

Refer to Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 for information\nabout using functions in the curses, X, and Motif libraries.\n2.1 Using Codesets\nIn the past, most UNIX systems were based on the 7-bit ASCII codeset.\nHowever, most non-English languages include characters in addition to\nthose contained in the ASCII codeset.\nThe X/Open UNIX standard does not require an operating system to supply\nany particular codesets in addition to ASCII. The standard does specify\nrequirements for the interfaces that manipulate characters so that programs\nare able to handle characters from whatever codeset is available on a given\nsystem.\nThe first group of the International Standards Organization (1SO) codesets\ncovered only the major European languages. In this group, several codesets\nallow for the mixing of major languages within a single codeset. All of these\ncodesets are a superset of the ASCII codeset, and therefore systems can\nsupport non-English languages without invalidating existing software that\nis not internationalized. A Tru64 UNIX operating system always includes a\nlocale for the United States that uses the |SO 8859-1 (ISO Latin-1) codeset.\nSubsets that support localized variants of the operating system may include\nlocales based on additional |SO codesets. For example, the optional language\nvariant subsets included with Tru64 UNIX to support Czech, Hungarian,\nPolish, Russian, Slovak, and Slovene provide locales based on the ISO\n8859-2 (Latin-2) codeset. Following is a complete list of |SO codesets with\nthe languages that they support and the reference pages where they are\ndiscussed in more detail:\ne ISO 8859-1, Latin-1\nWestern European languages, including Catalan, Danish, Dutch,\nEnglish, Finnish, French, German, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian,\nPortuguese, Spanish, and Swedish\nSee iso8859-1(5)\n2-2 Developing Internationalized Software\n\nISO 8859-2, Latin-2\nEastern European languages, including Albanian, Czech, English,\nGerman, Hungarian, Polish, Rumanian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovak, and\nSlovene\nSee is08859-2(5)\n1SO 8859-3, Latin-3\nAfrikaans, Catalan,", "start_char": 52650, "end_char": 54850}

Programs cannot assume that\na particular codeset is on all systems that conform to requirements in the\nX/Open UNIX CAE specifications, nor that individual characters occupy a\nfixed number of bits.\nAnother legacy of the historical dependence of UNIX systems on 7-bit ASCII\ncharacter encoding is that some programs use the most significant bit of\na byte for their own internal purposes. This was a dubious programming\npractice, although quite safe when characters in the underlying codeset\nalways mapped to the remaining 7 bits of the byte. In the world of\ninternational codesets, the practice of using the most significant bit of a byte\nfor program purposes must be avoided.\n2-6 Developing Internationalized Software\n\n2.1.2 Using In-Code Literals\nWhen writing internationalized software, using in-code literals can cause\nproblems. Consider, for example, the following conditional statement:\nif ((c = getchar()) == \\141)\nThis condition assumes that lowercase a is always represented by a fixed\noctal value, which may not be true for all codesets. The following statement\nrepresents an improvement in that it substitutes a character constant for\nthe octal value:\nif ((c = getchar()) == ‘a’)\nThis example still presents problems, however, because the get char ()\nfunction operates on bytes.

It is therefore safe for you to use any of the characters in the PCS as\na character constant or in string literals.

Language variant subsets of the\noperating system must be installed to supply the locales and facilities that\nmake this support operational. On systems where such locales are not\navailable, or are available and not bound to the program at run time, the\n*ws* and *wc* functions are merely synonyms for the associated single-byte\nfunctions (such as putc(), getc(), fputs(),and fgets()).\n2.1.4 Converting Between Multibyte-Character and Wide-Character\nData\nOn an internationalized system, data can be encoded as either\nmultibyte-character or wide-character data.\n2-8 Developing Internationalized Software\n\nMultibyte encoding is typically the encoding used when data is stored ina\nfile or generated for external use or data interchange. Multibyte encoding\nhas the following disadvantages:\n¢ Characters are not represented by a fixed number of bytes per character,\neven in the same codeset, so the size of a character in a multibyte data\nrecord can vary from one character to the next.\n¢ Theparsing rules for retrieving character codes from a multibyte data\nrecord are locale dependent.\nBecause of these disadvantages, wide-character encoding, which allocates a\nfixed", "start_char": 64350, "end_char": 66550}

The size of a wide character varies from\none system implementation to another. On Tru64 UNIX systems, the size\nfor a wide character is set to 4 bytes (32 bits), a setting that optimizes\nperformance for the Alpha processor.\nLibrary routines that print, scan, input, or output text can automatically\nconvert data from multibyte characters to wide characters or from wide\ncharacters to multibyte characters, as appropriate for the operation.\nHowever, applications almost always have additional statements or\nrequirements for which conversion to and from multibyte characters needs\nto be explicit.\nThe following example is from a program module that reads records from a\ndatabase of employee data.

The encodings do not have to be the same,\nbut both set variants observe certain rules in codesets that meet X/Open\nrequirements. PC code pages and UCS-based codesets may adhere to some\nor most of these rules, but the codesets native to any UNIX system that\nconforms to X/Open standards must adhere to all of them.\n¢ Thecharacters defined in the Portable Character Set must be present\nin both sets.\n« The existence, meaning, and encoding of any additional members are\nlocale specific.\ne« A character may have a state-dependent encoding. A string of\ncharacters may contain a shift-state character that affects the system's\ninterpretation of the following bytes until another shift-state character\nis encountered.\n¢ Whilein the initial shift state, all characters from the basic character set\nretain their usual interpretation and do not alter the shift state.\n¢« Theinterpretation for subsequent bytes in the sequence is a function\nof the current shift state.\n¢ A byte with all bits set to zero is interpreted as a null character,\nindependent of the shift state.\n¢« A byte with all bits zero must not occur in the second or subsequent bytes\nof a multibyte character.\nThe source variant of a codeset must observe the following additional rules:\n« A comment, string literal, character constant, or header name must\nbegin and end in the initial shift state.\n« A comment, string literal, character constant, or header name must\nconsist of a sequence of valid multibyte characters.\nThe C language compiler also supports trigraph sequences when you\nspecify the -std1 or -std flag on the cc command line.

The following trigraph sequences are\n2-10 Developing Internationalized Software\n\ncurrently defined, each of which is replaced by the corresponding single\ncharacter:\nTrigraph Sequence Single Character\n2?= #\n2? ( [\n2e/ \\\n2?! a\n??< {\n22) ]\n2?! |\n??> }\n2?- ~\n2.1.6 Classifying Characters\nAnother feature of program operation that depends on the locale is character\nClassification; that is, determining whether a particular character code\nrefers to an uppercase alphabetic, lowercase alphabetic, digit, punctuation,\ncontrol, or space character.\nIn the past, many programs classified characters according to whether the\ncharacter’s value fell between certain numerical limits. For example, the\nfollowing statement tests for all uppercase alphabetic characters:\nif (c >= ‘A’ && c <= 'Z')\nThis statement is valid for the ASCII codeset, in which all uppercase letters\nhave values in the range 0x41 to 0x5a (A to Z). However, the statement is\nnot valid for the |SO 8859-1 codeset, in which uppercase letters occupy the\nranges 0x41 to 0x5a, OxcO to Oxdé, and Oxd8 to Oxdf. In the EBCDIC\ncodeset, character values are different again and, in this case, even the\nuppercase English letters have a different encoding.\nWhen you write internationalized programs, classify characters by calling\nthe appropriate internationalization function. For example:\nif (iswupper (c))\nInternationalization functions classify wide-character code values according\nto ctype information in the user’s locale. Refer to Section A.2 for a complete\nlist and description of character classification functions.\nDeveloping Internationalized Software 2-11\n\n2.1.7 Converting Characters\nYou can do case conversion of ASCII characters with statements such as\nthe following ones, which convert the character in a_var first to lowercase\nand then to uppercase:\na_var |= 0x20;\na_var &= Oxdf;\nThe preceding statements are not safe to use in internationalized pr", "start_char": 70200, "end_char": 72400}

For example:\na_var = towlower(a_var) ;\na_var = towupper(a_var) ;\nThese functions use information specified in the user’s locale and are\nindependent of the codeset where characters are defined. The functions\nreturn the argument unchanged if input is invalid. Refer to Section A.3 for\nmore detailed discussion of case conversion functions.\n2.1.8 Comparing Strings\nUNIX systems have always provided functions for comparing character\nstrings. The following statement, for example, compares the strings s1 and\ns2, returning an integer greater than, equal to, or less than zero, depending\non whether the value of s1 is greater than, equal to, or less than the value of\ns2 in the machine-collating sequence:\nint cmp val;\nchar *s1;\nchar *s2;\ncmp _val = strcmp(sl1, s2);\n2-12 Developing Internationalized Software\n\nMany languages, however, require more complex collation algorithms than a\nsimple numerical sort. For example, multiple passes may be required for\nthe following reasons:\nOrdering accented characters within a particular character class for a\nlanguage (for example, a, a, a, and so on)\nCollating certain multiple character sequences as a single character (for\nexample, the Welsh character ch, which collates after c and before d)\nCollating certain single characters as a 2-character sequence (for\nexample, the German character sharp s, which collates as ss)\nIgnoring certain characters during collation (for example, hyphens in\ndictionary words)\nString comparison in an international environment thus depends on the\ncodeset and language.

The\nfollowing sections discuss this database and the functions used to extract\nand process its data items.\n2.2.1 The langinfo Database\nThe language information database, named langinfo, contains items that\nrepresent the cultural details of each locale supported on the system. The\nlanginfo database contains the following information for each locale, as\nrequired by the X/Open UNIX standard:\n* Codeset name\n¢ Date and time formats\n¢« Names of the days of the week\n« Names of the months of the year\n¢« Abbreviations for names of days\ne Abbreviations for names of months\n¢« Radix character (the character that separates whole and fractional\nquantities\n¢« Thousands separator character\n¢ Affirmative and negative responses for yes/no queries\n¢ Currency symbol and its position within a currency value\n2-14 Developing Internationalized Software\n\n¢ Emperor/Era name and year (for |a panese locales)\n2.2.2 Querying the langinfo Database\nYou can extract cultural data items from the langinfo database by calling\nthenl langinfo() function.

The difference is that\nwesftime() converts date and time to wide-character format.\nIn the following example, the strftime () function generates a date string\nas defined by the D_ FMT item in the langinfo database:\nsetlocale(LACL_L , \"\"); [1\nclock = time((time t*)NULL); [2\ntm = localtime(&clock); [3\nstrftime(buf, size, \"%x\", tm); |4\nputs(buf); {5\n1] Binds the program at run time to the locale set for the system or\nindividual user.\n2} Calls the time () subroutine to return the time value, relative to\nCoordinated Universal Time, to the clock variable.\n3] Calls the localtime() function to convert the value contained in\nclock toa value that can be stored in a tm structure, whose members\nrepresent values for year, month, day, hour, minute, and so forth.\nDeveloping Internationalized Software 2-15\n\n4) Calls strftime() togeneratea date string formatted as defined in the\nuser’s locale from the value contained in the tm structure.\nThe buf argument is a pointer toa string variable in which the date\nstring is returned. The size argument contains the maximum size of\nbuf. The \"%x\" argument specifies conversion specifications, similar\nto the format strings used with the printf () and scanf () functions.\nThe \"sx\" argument is replaced in the output string by representation\nappropriate for the locale.\n5] Calls the puts () function to copy the string contained in buf tothe\nstandard output stream (stdout) and to append a newline character.\nThe following example shows how touse strftime() andnl_langinfo()\nin combination to generate a date and time string.

The\nstrptime() supports a number of conversion specifiers that behave in\na locale-dependent manner.\n2.2.4 Formatting Monetary Values\nThe strfmon () function formats monetary values according to information\nin the locale that is bound to the program at run time. For example:\nstrfmon(buf, size, \"%n\", value);\nThis statement formats the double-precision floating-point value contained\nin the value variable. The \"%n\" argument is the format specification that\nis replaced by the format defined in the run-time locale. The results are\nreturned tothe buf array, whose maximum length is contained in the size\nvariable.\nThe money program demonstrates how the strfmon() function\nworks.

For\nexample, the wscanf (), worintf(), and wcestod() functions determine\nthe appropriate radix character from information in the langinfo database.\n2.3 Handling Text Presentation and Input\nThe language of the program user affects:\ne« The way program messages are defined and accessed\n¢ How the program presents output text\n¢« How the program processes input text\nThese considerations are discussed in the following sections.\nDeveloping Internationalized Software 2-17\n\n2.3.1 Creating and Using Messages\nPrograms need to communicate with users in their own language. This\nrequirement places some constraints on the way program messages are\ndefined and accessed. More specifically, messages are defined in a file that\nis independent of the program source code and are not compiled into object\nfiles. Because messages are in a separate file, they can be translated into\ndifferent languages and stored in a form that is linked to the program at\nrun time. Programs can then retrieve message text translations that are\nappropriate for the user’s language.\nThe X/Open UNIX standard specifies:\ne« A messaging system that contains a definition of messagetext source files\n« Thegencat command to generate message catalogs from these source\nfiles\n¢ A set of library functions to retrieve individual messages from one or\nmore catalogs at run time\nThe following example shows how an internationalized program retrieves a\nmessage from a catalog:\n#include <stdio.h> 1\n#include <locale.h> 2\n#include <nl_types.h> |8\n#include \"prog _msg.h\" 4\nmain ()\n{\nnl_catd catd; [5\nsetlocale(LC_ALL, \"\"); [6\ncatd = catopen(\"prog.cat\", NL CAT LOCALE); [7\nputs(catgets(catd, SETN, HELLO MSG, \"Hello, world!\")); |8\ncatclose(catd); |9\n1] Includes the header file for the Standard C Library.\n2]", "start_char": 81900, "end_char": 84100}

The\ndescriptor is also passed as an argument to the function that closes\nthe catalog.\n6] Callsthe setlocale() function to bind the program's locale categories\nto settings for the user’s locale environment variables.\nThe locale name set for the LC_MESSAGES category is the locale used by\nthe catopen() and catgets() functions in this example. Typically,\nthe system manager or user sets only the LANG or LC_ALL environment\nvariable to a particular locale name, and this operation implicitly sets\nthe LC_MESSAGES variable as well.\n7] Calls the catopen() function to open the prog. cat message catalog\nfor use by this program.\nTheNL_CAT_LOCALE argument specifies that the program will use\nthe locale name set for LC_MESSAGES. The catopen() function uses\nthe value set for the NLSPATH environment variable to determine the\nlocation of the message catalog. The call returns the message catalog\ndescriptor to the catd variable.\n8] Calls the puts () function to display the message.\nThe first argument tothis call isa call tothe catgets () function, which\nretrieves the appropriate text for the message with the HELLO MSG\nidentifier.

This message is contained in the message set identified by\nthe SETN constant. The final argument to catgets() is the default\ntext to be used if the messaging call cannot retrieve the translated text\nfrom the catalog. Default text is usually in English.\n9] Calls the catclose() function to close the message catalog whose\ndescriptor is contained in the catd variable.\nRefer to Chapter 3 for information about creating and using message\ncatalogs.\n2.3.2 Formatting Output Text\nSuccessful translation of messages into different languages depends not only\non making messages independent of the program source code but also on\ncareful construction of message strings within the program.\nConsider the following example:\nprintf (catgets(catd, set_id, WRONG OWNER MSG,\n\"Ss is owned by %s\\n\"),\nfolder name, user name) ;\nDeveloping Internationalized Software 2-19\n\nThe preceding statement uses a message catalog but assumes a particular\nlanguage construction (a noun followed by a verb in passive voice followed by\na noun). Passive-verb constructions are not part of all languages; therefore,\nmessage translation might mean printing user_name before folder_name.\nIn other words, the translator might need to change the construction of the\nmessage so that the user sees the translated equivalent of “J ohn_Smith owns\nJ ULY_REVENUE” rather than “J ULY_REVENUE is owned byJ ohn_Smith.”\nTo overcome the problems imposed by fixed ordering of message elements,\nthe format specifiers for the printf () routine have been extended so\nthat format conversion applies to the nth argument in an argument list\nrather than to the next unused argument. To apply the format conversion\nextension, replace the % conversion character with the sequence digit §,\nwhere digit specifies the position of the argument in the argument list.\nThe following example illustrates how the programmer applies this feature\nto the format string\"%s is owned by %s\\n\":\nprintf (catgets(catd, set_id, WRONG_OWNER_ MSG,\n\"S1S5s is owned by %2$s\\n\"),\nfolder name, user name) ;\nThe construction of t", "start_char": 85800, "end_char": 88000}

For example, in different countries\nthere are different conventions that apply to the order in which users specify\nthe elements of a date or there are differences in characters that are input to\ndelimit parts of monetary or other numeric strings. Therefore, the scanf ()\nfamily of functions also Support extended format conversion specifiers to\nallow for variation in the way that users enter elements of a string.\nConsider the following example:\nint day;\nint month;\nint year;\nscanf (\"%d/%d/%d\", &month, &day, &year);\n2-20 Developing Internationalized Software\n\nThe format string in this statement is governed by the assumption that\nall users use a United States format (mm/dd/yyyy) to input dates. In an\ninternationalized program, you use extended format specifiers to support\nrequirements that language may impose on the order of string elements.\nFor example:\nscanf (catgets(catd, NL SETD, DATE STRING,\n\"$18da/%2Sda/%3Sd\"), &month, &day, &year);\nThe default \"%1$d/%2$da/%3$d\" value for the DATE_STRING messageis\nstill appropriate only for countries where users use the format mm/dd/yyyy\nto enter dates. However, for countries in which the order or formatting\nwould be different, the translator can change the entry in the program’s\nmessage file. For example:\n¢ British English (dd/mm/yyyy):\nDATE_STRING \"S28d/%1$d/%3$a\"\n* German (dd.mm.yyyy)\nDATE STRING \"S2Sda.%1Sd.%3Sda\"\n2.4 Binding a Locale to the Run-Time Environment\nFor an internationalized program to operate correctly, it must bind to\nlocalized data that is appropriatfeo r the user at run time.

The setlocale ()\nfunction performs this task. You can call setlocale() to:\n¢ Bind to locale settings that are already in effect for the user’s process\n¢ Bind tolocale settings controlled by the program\n* Query current locale settings without changing them\nThe call takes two arguments: category and locale_name.\nThe category argument specifies whether you want to query, change, or\nuse all or a specific section of a locale. Values for category and what they\nrepresent are as follows:\n* LC ALL, all sections of a locale\n* LC CTYPE, the locale section that classifies characters\n* LC COLLATE, the locale section that specifies character collation order\n* LC MESSAGES, the locale section that specifies yes/no responses and\nprogram messages\nDeveloping Internationalized Software 2-21\n\n* LC MONETARY, the locale section that specifies special characters used\nin monetary values\n* LC NUMERIC, the locale section that specifies the characters used for\ndecimal point and thousands separator\n* LC_TIME, the locale section that specifies names and abbreviations\nfor days of the week and months of the year, and other strings and\nformatting conventions that govern expressions of date and time\nThe locale name argument is one of the following values:\n¢ Anempty string (\"\") to bind the program at run time to the locale name\nset for category by the system manager or user\n¢ A localenameto change the locale that may already beset for category\n* NULL todetermine the locale name currently set for category\n2.4.1. Binding to the Locale Set for the System or User\nTypically, the system manager or user sets the LANG or LC_ALL environment\nvariable to the name of a locale; setting either of these variables\nautomatically sets all locale category variables to the same locale name.\nOn occasion (if they do not use LC_ALL), system managers or individual\nusers may set locale category variables to different locale names.

The following example\nshows how to call set locale () when you want to explicitly initialize or\nreinitialize all locale categories to the same locale name:\nnl_catd catd; |1\nchar buf[BUFSIZ]; |2\nsetlocale(LC_ALL, \"\"); |8\ncatd = catopen(CAT NAME, NL CAT LOCALE) ; >\nprintf (catgets(catd, NL SETD, LOCALE PROMPT MSG,\n\"Enter locale name: \")); 5\n2-22 Developing Internationalized Software\n\ngets(buf); {6\nsetlocale(LC ALL, buf); [7\n1] Declares a catalog descriptor catd as typenl c_ atd.\n2] Declares the buf variable into which thelocale name will later be stored.\nTo make sure that the variable is large enough to accommodate\nlocale names on different systems, you should set its maximum size\nto the BUFSIZz constant, which is defined by the system vendor in\n/usr/include/stdio.h.\n3] Calls setlocale() toinitialize the program's locale settings to those\nin effect for the user who runs the program.\n4) Calls catopen() to open the message catalog that contains the\nprogram's messages; returns the catalog’s descriptor to the catd\nvariable.\nThe CAT_NAME constant is defined in the program’s own header file.\n5] Prompts the user for a new locale name.\nTheNL_SETD constant specifies the default message set number ina\nmessage catalog and is defined in /usr/include/nl_types.h.

The difference between the two sets of\nlocalization data is that data elements in the langinfo database are used\nby all applications, including the library routines, commands, and utilities\nprovided by the operating system. The langinfo database is generated\nfrom the source files that define locales. Message catalogs, on the other\nhand, meet the specific localization needs of one program or a set of related\nprograms. Message catalogs are generated from message text source files\nthat contain error and informational messages, prompts, background text for\nforms, and miscellaneous strings and constants that must vary for language\nand cultural reasons.\nX and Motif applications, which includea graphical user interface, usually\naccess X resource files, rather than message catalogs, for the small segments\nof text that belong to the title bars, menus, buttons, and simple messages\nfor a particular window. Motif applications can also use a User Interface\nLanguage (UIL) file, along with a text library file, to access help, error\nmessage, and other kinds of text. However, both X and Motif applications\ncan access text in message catalogs as well.\nThis chapter focuses on message catalogs and explains how to:\n¢ Create, edit, extract, and translate message text source files\n* Generate message catalogs\ne Access message catalogs interactively and from scripts\ne Access message catalogs from programs\nRefer to the OSF/ Motif Programmer’s Guide for inform", "start_char": 93600, "end_char": 95800}

Refer\nto Section 3.1.2 for more information about defining and removing\nmessage sets.\nMost lines in the source file are message entries, whose components are\na unique identifier and a message text string. The first message entry\nis continued to the next line by using the backslash (\\). Other entries\ncontain special character sequences, such as \\n (newline), that affect\nhow the message is printed. Refer to Section 3.1.3 for more information\nabout message entries. Section 3.1.1 also discusses some rules and\noptions that apply to message entries.\nThis entry allows translators to vary the order in which users are\nprompted toinput date elements. Note that you frequently use message\nentries to allow format control.\nMessage entries such as these define word abbreviations, which often\nneed special attention to preserve uniqueness from one language to\nanother.\nMessage entries also define header lines for menu displays so that\ntranslators can adjust the field order and line length to match other\nadjustments that the program allows for cultural variation.\nIn the xpg4demo program, you can change the order of first and last\nname (surname).

A message text source file (.msg file) comprises Sequences of messages.\nOptionally, you can order these messages within one or more message sets.\nFor a given application, there are usually separate message source files for\neach localization; for example, there are source files for each locale (each\ncombination of codeset, language, and territory) with which users can run\nthe application.\nIf you do not quote values for identifiers, specify a single space or tab, as\ndefined by the source codeset, to separate fields in lines of the source file.\nOtherwise, the extra spaces or tabs are treated as part of the value. Using\nthe character specified in a quote directive to delimit all message strings\nprevents extra spaces or tabs between the identifier and the string from\nbeing treated as part of the string. Quoting message strings is also the only\nway to indicate that the message text includes a trailing space or tab.\nMessage text strings can contain ordinary characters, plus sequences for\nspecial characters as shown in Table 3-1.\nTable 3-1: Coding of Special Characters in Message Text Source Files\nDescription Symbol Coding Sequence\nNewline NL (LF) \\n\nHorizontal tab HT \\t\nVertical tab VT \\v\nBackspace BS \\b\nCarriage return CR \\r\nForm feed FF \\f\nBackslash \\ \\\\\nOctal value ddd \\ ddd 4\nHexadecimal value dddd \\ xdddd >\n9 The excape sequence\\ ddd consists of a backslash followe", "start_char": 99450, "end_char": 101650}

In this context, entering a newline\ncharacter means pressing the Return or Enter key on English keyboards.\nFor example, the following two entries are equivalent and do not affect how\nthe string appears to the program user:\nMSG_ID This line continues \\\nto the next line.\nMSG_ID This line continues to the next line.\nAny empty lines in a message source file are ignored; you are therefore free\nto use blank lines wherever you choose to improve the readability of the file.\n3.1.2 Message Sets\nMessage sets are an optional component within message text source\nfiles.

Expect even larger increases\nfor strings containing fewer than 20 characters.\nThe following guidelines result from the likelihood that text strings will\ngrow when translated from English to another language:\n- If you must limit a text string to oneline (for example, 80 characters),\nmake sure the English text occupies no more than half of the\navailable space. Whenever possible, allow text to wrap toa\nsubsequent line rather than restricting it to an arbitrary length.\n3-10 Creating and Using Message Catalogs\n\nDo not design a menu, form, screen, or window in which English text\nuses most of the available space.\nDesign a dialog box so that its components can be moved around. The\ndevelopers who localize your application may have to reorganize the\ncontents of a dialog box because of text length changes and, for Asian\nlanguages, to accommodate a particular character input method.\nDo not embed text in a graphic. When text is embedded in a graphic,\nthe entire graphic must be redone when the application is localized.\nFurthermore, the translated text may cause the graphic to grow\nin size or to lose visual appeal.\nNouns in languages other than English may have gender that affects\nthe spelling of the noun itself and associated adjectives and verbs.\nThe way a noun is spelled can also change, depending on whether the\nnoun is the subject or object of a verb, or the object of a preposition.\nThere can be additional grammatical rules, such as those for creating\naffirmative, negative and imperative verb forms, that are very different\nfrom English. For these reasons:\nDo not create a message at run time by concatenating different\nkinds of strings; for example, strings that represent different nouns,\nadjectives, verbs, or combinations of these.\nIf adjectives and verbs can have multiple referents, each with\na different gender, the translator may not be able to create a\ngrammatically correct counterpart for all the possible sentences that\nthe user may see.

Furthermore, you cannot assume\nthat there is a one-to-one correspondence between English words and\ntheir counterparts in other languages. For example, you can create\na negative statement in English by inserting a text variable that\ncontains the word “not” into a verb phrase. The message could not\nbe translated to French, however, which usually requires two words,\n“ne” before the verb and “pas” after the verb, to negate meaning.\nPathnames, file names, and strings that are complete sentences are\nusually safe to insert into other strings.\nAvoid using the word “None” as a button label or menu item; this word\nmay be impossible to translate if its referents have different gender.\nCreate messages that are complete sentences; in particular, do not\nstart messages (other than imperatives where the subject “you” is\nunderstood) with a verb.\nCreating and Using Message Catalogs 3-11\n\nThe following messages cannot be translated into some languages\nbecause the translator cannot determine the subject of the sentence\nor the correct form of the verb in the local language:\nIs a directory.\nCould not open file.\nIf your message is constructed of a facility identifier, followed by\ninformational or error text, you can break the rule about starting\nmessages with a verb.

Use the following guidelines to help ensure\naccurate translation:\n- Include articles (the, a, an) and forms of the verb “to be” where\nappropriate. Programmers often omit these words to reduce the\nsize of message strings; however, the omission sometimes makes\nit difficult to distinguish nouns from verbs, subject nouns from\npredicate nouns, and active voice from passive voice. The message\n“Maximum parameter count exceeded” illustrates this problem.\n- You can include very common contractions, such as “can’t” and\n“don't”, but avoid less commonly used contractions, like “should’ve”.\nIf you are using contractions in English to conserve line space, be\naware that your objective is likely to be lost in translation.\n- Avoid using most abbreviations, particularly terms, such as pkt,\nmsg, tbl, ack, and max, that programmers commonly use in variable\nnames and code comments.

The following sections\ndescribe these features. For complete information on using routines from\nthe X Toolkit Intrinsics Library (1ibxt) in your applications, refer to the\nreference pages for individual components.\n5-2 Creating Internationalized X, Xt, and Motif Applications\n\n5.1.1 Establishing a Locale with Xt Functions\nAn internationalized X Toolkit application must parse resources in a\nlocale-dependent manner. Therefore, an application must establish its\nlocale before initializing the resource database. But it is also true that the\napplication’s locale can be specified by resources. To solve this paradox,\nRelease 5 of the X Toolkit introduced the language procedure, which is\nregistered before initializing X Toolkit and then called during initialization\nat the appropriate time to set locale. The xt Set LanguageProc ( ) function\nregisters the language procedure for setting the locale. By default, this\nfunction first calls the Standard C Library function setlocale() toset\nthe locale and then calls the X Library functions XSupportsLocale( )\nand XSetLocaleModifiers () toinitialize the locale. An application that\nuses the X Toolkit routines must call xtSetLanguageProc(), even if the\napplication uses the system default language procedure; otherwise, the\nlocale is not set and other Xt routines do not behave in a locale-dependent\nmanner. One of the most common ways to set locale is for applications to\nmake the following call before calling XtAppInitialize():\nXtSetLanguageProc (NULL, NULL,NULL) ;\nAfter calling xtSetLanguageProc(), your application can then call one of\nthe following Xt initialization functions:\n* XtInitialize()\n¢ XtAppInitialize()\n* XtOpenDisplay()\nThese functions call XtD", "start_char": 181350, "end_char": 183550}

The XtDisplayInitialize( )\nfunction then calls the language procedure registered by the call to\nXtSetLanguageProc(), passing it the xnlLanguage value as an\nargument. After that, XtDisplayInitialize() parses resources in the\nlocale returned by the language procedure.\n5.1.2 Using Font Set Resources with Xt Functions\nThe Xt routines support the xFontSet structure in place of the\nXFontStruct structure in any internationalized widgets that draw\nnative-language text. The following resource attributes exist to support\nXFontSet:\n* XtNFontSet (the resource name)\n* xXtCFontSet (the resource class)\n* XtRFontSet (the resource representation type)\nCreating Internationalized X, Xt, and Motif Applications 5-3\n\nThe X Toolkit includes a converter that changes a preregistered string, such\nas -*-*-*-R-*-*-*-120-75-75-*-*-*-*, toa list of font sets in the\nstructure (xFontSet). The converter should establish a default font set list\nso that, if the string cannot be converted to a valid font set list, thereisa\nfallback to a valid font set.\n5.1.3 Filtering Events During Text Input with Xt Functions\nStarting with Release 5 of the X Toolkit Intrinsics, the xtDispatchEvent ( )\nfunction was changed to call XFilterEvent (). This change allows an\ninput method to intercept registered X events before being processed by an\napplication that uses Xt routines.\n5.1.4 Including the Codeset Component of Locales with Xt Functions\nStarting with Release 5 of the X Toolkit Intrinsics, an integral locale entity\nsupports the codeset component, in addition to the language and territory\ncomponents supported by earlier releases.\n5.2 Using Internationalization Features of the OSF/Motif\nand DECwindows Motif Toolkits\nThe chapter on internationalization features in the OSF/ Motif Programmer's\nGuide discusses how you internationalize Mo", "start_char": 183300, "end_char": 185500}

The following\nsections are a Supplement to information in that chapter.\n5.2.1 Setting Language in a Motif Application\nMost of the internationalization features in the OSF /Motif Toolkit (1ibxm)\nand the DECwindows Extensions to the OSF /Motif Toolkit (1ibDxm) are\nsupported through features first introduced in Release 5 of the X Library\n(1ibx) and the X Toolkit (libxt). Motif internationalization features are\nalso supported the same way when Release 6 or Release 6.3 of the X Library\nand X Toolkit are installed. For example, to establish the locale of your\nMotif application, you use the same set of functions and guidelines as\ndescribed for an Xt application. (See Section 5.1.1.) If your application\nfails to call xtSetLanguageProc() before initializing X Toolkit to\nregister the language procedure, the Motif widgets do not support the\ninternationalization features discussed in subsequent sections; in other\nwords, the widgets revert to behavior expected in releases earlier than X\nToolkit Release 5 and OSF /Motif Release 1.2.\nThe language for an application can be specified by:\n¢ Thevalue of the argv argument on the call toxXtAppInitialize(),\nXtOpenDisplay(), XtDisplayInitialize(), Or XtOpenAppli-\ncation( )\n5-4 Creating Internationalized X, Xt, and Motif Applications\n\n¢« Thesetting of the language resource in the RESOURCE MANAGER property\nof the root window for the specified display\n¢ Thesetting of the xnlLanguage resourcein the user’s .Xdefaults file\n¢« Thesetting of the LANG environment variable\nElements higher on the preceding list take precedence over lower elements.\nNote the following points:\ne After an application opens its first display, Motif routines use the\nestablished language setting until the application terminates.\ne |f the RESOURCE MANAGER property exists in the root window, Motif\nroutines do not use the .

The\nwidgets use the codeset of the current locale to encode text information that\nusers enter and display. To display the data in the correct fonts, the widgets\nuse the following search pattern to locate the fonts:\n¢ Search the font list for an entry that is a font set and has the font list\nelement tag XmFONTLIST DEFAULT TAG\n¢ Search the font list for an entry that specifies a font set and use the\nfirst one found\ne Usethe first font in the font list\nItems in the preceding list are in precedence order from highest to lowest;\nthe widgets stop the search when an item higher on the list determines\nthe font set.\nThe internationalization features available through the text widgets have\nchanged from earlier OSF /Motif releases on the following two dimensions:\n¢« Thesegments of a compound string can contain data from multiple\ncharacter sets.

To obtain data input, the application calls\nXmbLookupString() of XwcLookupString() with an input context.\nThe strings returned are always encoded in the locale associated with\nthe XIM/XIC objects.

If translations are available for message files, you can\nvary the language of software messages and other text by selecting a locale.\nFor system software, you set locale by defining the LANG environment\nvariable. For example:\n% setenv LANG en US.ISO8859-1\nRefer to the discussion of internationalization in the Systen Administration\nbook and in the Command and Shel User's Guide for more detailed\ninformation on using locales and defining the associated variables for system\nand user setup. You can also refer tothe 118n_intro(5) reference page for a\ndiscussion of locale variables such as LANG. If these locale variables are not\ndefined, internationalized applications assume the POSIX (C) locale, which\nsupports only English. For names of locales that are available with the\noperating system, see 110n_intro(5).\nNote\nLocales often have multiple variants. These variants have the\nsame name as the base locale but include a file name suffix\nthat begins with the at sign (@.

Locale variants for support of\ncodesets, such as UCS-4 and cp850, that are not native to UNIX,\ncan be assigned to LANG or LC_ALL. However, locale variants\nthat differ from the base locale in only one locale category\nshould be assigned only to the appropriate locale category. F or\nexample, a locale variant designed to support a specific collation\nsequence, such as @radicalwould be assigned to LC_COLLATE.\n6-2 Using Internationalized Software\n\nA locale variant designed to support the euro monetary sign\n(@euro) would be assigned only to LC_MONETARY. Use the base\nlocale name, not these variants, in assignments to the LANG\nenvironment variable. Furthermore, in cases where a base locale\nname is not being assigned to all locale categories, avoid using the\nLC_ALL environment variable, whose assigned value overrides\nsettings for both LANG and the environment variables for specific\nlocale categories.\nMany locale-specific files reside in directories whose names are\nconstructed from the language, territory, and codeset portions of\na locale name. Commands and other system applications insert\nthe setting of the LANG variable into search paths that contain %L\nas one of the directory nodes. This makes it possible for software\nprograms to find the correct set of files, such as fonts, resource\nfiles, user-defined character files, and translated reference pages,\nthat should be used with the current locale.

Refer to the CDE Companion for more information\nabout changing keyboard type. From the system command line, this\napplication is invoked by using the dxkeyboard command.\nUnlike the language setting, the keyboard setting is a global attribute that\napplies to all windows. Therefore, if you are working in windows that\nwere created with different language settings, you may need to change\nthe keyboard setting as you move from one window to another. Keep in\nmind that no matter what setting is made by using CDE applications,\nthat setting does not change the setting that applies when you log on the\nsystem. The keyboard setting when you log on the system is always the\nsystem-default keyboard. See keyboard(5) for information about changing\nthe system-default keyboard.\n6-4\nUsing Internationalized Software\n\n6.3.1 Determining Keyboard Layout\nIf you change your keyboard from the one whose characters are printed on\nthe hardware keys, you need to know how characters are mapped to keys\nand whether any characters must be entered by using a mode-switch key or\nmode-switch key sequence. F or some languages, such as Czech, up to four\ndifferent characters can be mapped to the same key. In such cases, you\nuse the key defined as the mode switch to toggle among different sets of\ncharacters mapped to the same key.

An input method lets you\ninput a character by taking multiple editing actions on entry data. The data\nentered at intermediate stages of character entry is called the preediting\nstring. The X Input Method specification defines four user input styles:\n¢« On-the-spot\nData being edited is displayed directly in the application window.\nApplication data is moved to allow the preediting string to display at\nthe point of character insertion.\n¢ Over-the-spot\nThe preediting string is displayed in a window that is positioned over\nthe point of insertion.\n¢ Off-thespot\nThe preediting string is displayed in a window that is within the\napplication window but not over the point of insertion. Often, the\nwindow for the preediting string appears at the bottom of the application\nwindow. In this case, the preediting window may occlude the last line of\ntext in the application window. You can resize the application window to\nmake this last line visible.\n¢ Root-window\nUsing Internationalized Software 6-5\n\nThe preediting string is displayed in a child window of the application\nRootWindow.\nFor some of the input styles selected in an application, the preediting and\nstatus windows are not redrawn correctly if the application window is\noccluded by other windows.

However, see Section 6.15.5 for restrictions that\nmay require you to start an input server manually.\n6.5 Determining the Input Mode Switch State\nThe keyboard layout for an Asian language provides keys for only a\nsmall number of characters. For Asian languages, you also use an input\nmethodology (incorporating control-key sequences, keypad-key sequences,\nor options in a windows application) to convert one or more characters\nthat you can input directly from the keyboard to other kinds of characters.\nSection 6.4 and the language-specific technical reference guides discuss\ninput methods for Asian languages.\nIf your keyboard has a mode-switch LED (light emitting diode), it is turned\non or off, depending on whether you last toggled the special input mode\non or off.\nIf you are using a workstation and your language is set to an Asian language,\nyou can show the mode-switch LED on the screen by invoking the K eyboard\nIndicator application with the -map option, as follows:\n% /usr/bin/X11/kb indicator -map &\nThe -map option starts a Motif application that emulates a mode-switch\nLED.

The character\nbeing erased can be either a single-byte English character or a multibyte\nAsian character when both occur on the same command line.\nWord deletion is also supported, even when words combine single-byte and\nmultibyte characters. The atty driver accepts single-byte space characters,\ntwo-byte space characters (if applicable to the terminal code setting), or\ntab characters as word delimiters.\nThe erase and werase options of the stty command line let you define the\ncontrol sequence for character and word deletion. For example:\n% stty erase |Ctrl-h\noe stty werase\nThis example specifies that Ctrl-h deletes the character preceding the cursor\nand Ctrl-j deletes the word preceding the cursor.\nHistory mode is a mode of command-line editing that allows you to recall\nand optionally modify a command entered previously.

You also need to use these filters if your printer is from another\nvendor. Both of these filters rely on a printer customization file (.pcf file)\nto supply certain device-specific information. Operating system software\nincludes a basic set of .pcf files. System administrators can add more .pcf\nfiles to describe the capabilities of additional printers used at your site.\n6.9.1.1 pcfof Print Filter\nThe pcfof filter handles both PostScript printers and text printers, such\nas the HP PCL printer.

For PostScript files, the filter requires that the\nappropriate local language PostScript fonts be available on the printer.\nThis restriction limits the filter’s usefulness on many Compaq printers,\nparticularly for printing PostScript files that require Ja panese fonts. This\nfilter can be set up to do codeset conversion when the printer locale differs\nfrom the one required for a text file print job. The filter alsohas .pcf files\nthat are appropriate to use for a number of third-party text printers. Refer\nto pcfof(8) and the Systen Administration manual for details on using\nthis print filter.\n6.9.1.2 wwpsof Print Filter\nThe wwpsof filter is used only with PostScript printers. The main advantage\nof this filter is that it does not require PostScript fonts to be printer resident\nbecause the filter can embed the required fonts in the print job. The\nPostScript fonts can be either outline fonts installed on the system or bitmap\nfonts made available to the filter through an X font server. The filter prints\nmultilanguage text files by first converting each character in the text file to\na matching character in a UNIX codeset for which fonts are available and\nthen converting the file to PostScript. The filter can also print PostScript\nfiles that have been generated by a CDE application. Refer to wwpsof(8) and\nthe Systen Administration manual for details on using this print filter.\n6.9.2 Print Filters for Specific Local Language Printers\nA print filter processes text data for a particular model of printer. The\nfilter handles the device dependencies of the printer and performs device\naccounting functions. When each print job is complete, the print filter writes\nan accounting record to the file specified by the af field of the printer’s entry\nin the /etc/printcap file.\nThe print filters for local-language text printers can handle text files that\ncontain ASCII and local-language characters, or output files created by\nthe nroff£ command.

Refer\nto sendmail(8), mailx(1), mh(1), comsat(8) for more complete software\ndescriptions.\n6.10.1 The sendmail Utility\nThe sendmail utility, which is a back end to several user commands, is\nconfigured by default to support 8-bit data. The configuration that supports\n8-bit data is required for multibyte character support. Refer to sendmail(8)\nfor restrictions that apply to the 8-bit configuration.\n6.10.2 The mailx Command and MH Commands\nThe mailx command and all applicable commands in the MH system\nsupport the conversion of mail messages between the mail interchange\ncodeset (used to transfer messages to some hosts) and a user’s application\ncodeset. F or example, if the mail interchange codeset is |SO-2022-] P and the\napplication codeset is euc P, the mailx or MH command converts incoming\nmessages to the] apanese EUC codeset before displaying them.\nTo prevent data loss, when incoming messages are stored in mail folders,\nthe messages are encoded in the codeset in which they are received.

A particular locale can apply one set of\ncollation rules to the associated character set. Multiple locale names\ndo exist, however, for the same combination of language, territory, and\ncharacter set. Most often, these variations exist to offer users the choice of\nmore than one collating sequence.\nWhen more than one locale is availablfeo r a given combination of language,\nterritory, and codeset, some of the locale names include a suffix with the\nformat @variant. To avoid problems with pathnames constructed using the\n%L specifier, you should assign a locale name with a suffix that is category\nspecific only to the appropriate locale category variable (or variables). In the\n6-34\nUsing Internationalized Software\n\nfollowing example, the locale assigned to LC_COLLATE differs from the locale\nassigned to LANG only with respect to collating sequence:\noe setenv LANG zh TW.eucTW\n% setenv LC COLLATE zh_T W.eucTW@radical\nSupporting different collation orders through oneor more locales is adequate\nfor most languages. However, collation orders for Asian languages require\nadditional support for the following reasons:\ne Asian languages include user-defined characters, which are not specified\nin alocale. These characters can be defined with a collation weight. In\nthis case, the collation weight needs to be applied when the user-defined\ncharacters are encountered in the strings being sorted.\n¢ |deographic characters can be sorted on more than one dimension\n(radical, stroke, phonetic, and internal code).

For another operation, the user may need to put characters\nfirst in phonetic order, then according to the number of strokes, and so\non. Sorting by combinations of dimensions requires breadth-first sorting,\nrather than the depth-first sorting implemented through locales.\nFor the preceding reasons, the asort command was developed and is\navailable when you install language variant subsets that support Asian\nlanguages. The asort command uses, by default, the collating order defined\nfor the LC_COLLATE variable and supports all the options supported by the\nsort command. In addition, the asort command includes the following\noptions:\n* -C\nThis option indicates that the sort operation should use special system\nsort tables, along with sort tables produced by the cgen utility to support\nuser-defined characters. This option overrides the sort sequence defined\nin the locale specified by the LC_COLLATE variable\n* =V3\nThis option, which you can use only with the —c option, implements\nbreadth-first sorting.\nRefer to asort(1) for more information about using this command.\n6.12 Processing Reference Pages in Languages Other\nThan English\nProgrammers who supply software applications for UNIX systems frequently\nsupply online reference pages (manpages) to document the application and\nits components.

A string of\nideographic characters, including 2-byte letters and punctuation characters,\ncan be wrapped to the next line subject to the following constraints:\n¢ Thelast character on the text line cannot be defined as a no-last\ncharacter by either the standard or private list of no-last characters.\n¢ The first character on the text line cannot be defined as a no-first\ncharacter by either the standard or private list of no-first characters.\nThe standard no-first, no-last character lists are defined in nroff catalog\nfiles.

You can turn the standard\nconstraints on and off in source files with the .ki and .ko commands,\nrespectively.\nYou can also define a private set of no-first and no-last characters with the\nfollowing command:\n.kl ‘'no-first-list'no-last-list'\nThe parameters no-first-list and no-last-list are strings of\ncharacters you should include in the no-first and no-last categories.

Therefore, you cannot use the standard\nset of no-first and no-last characters together with a private set.\nUsing the command .k1 '’”’ restores use of the standard set of\nno-first and no-last characters for the current locale.\nThe nroff command can format text so that it is justified or not justified to\nthe right margin. When text is justified to the right margin, nroff inserts\nspaces between words in the line. |d eographic characters, although treated\nas words in most stages of the formatting process, differ in terms of whether\nthey can be delimited by spaces.The characters that can be preceded by a\nspace, followed by a space, or both are listed in the language-specific user\nguides that are available on line when you install language variant subsets\nof Tru64 UNIX.

Therefore, if the LANG\nenvironment variable is set to an installed locale and if reference page\ntranslations are available for that locale, the man command automatically\ndisplays reference pages in the appropriate language.\nIn addition, the man command automatically applies codeset conversion\n(assuming the availability of appropriate converters) when reference page\ntranslations for a particular language are encoded in a codeset that does\nnot match the codeset of the user’s locale. Refer to man(1) for information\nabout redefining the man command search path and for more details about\ncodeset conversion.\n6.13 Converting Data Files from One Codeset to Another\nEach locale is based on a specific codeset. Therefore, when an application\nuses a file whose data is coded in one codeset and runs in a locale based on\nanother codeset, character interpretation may be meaningless.

Instead,\nonly as many characters as will fit in the memory cache are simultaneously\nloaded. When characters needed for display are not currently cached in\nmemory, the least recently used font glyphs are removed from the cache to\nmake room.

The\nsize of this subset varies from one language to another. For example,\napproximately 20,000 standard characters are supported for Taiwan\nbut only 5,000 of those characters are used frequently. Estimates for\nthe number of frequently used characters for other Asian countries is\nas follows: People’s Republic of China (3000), K orea (2000), and J apan\n(2000). F ont-cache parameters are tuned to accommodate the subset of\nfrequently used characters.\nTo change the cache size (which is the number of cache units) and the\nsize of each cache unit, you must modify the X Server configuration file\n/usr/1lib/X11/xdm/Xservers.

Varying names with the at (@) extension allows you to specify the\nstandard strings for language, territory, and codeset and still be sure that the\ntest locale is uniquely identified. This is important if you later decide to move\nthe locale to the /usr/1ib/nls/loc directory where other locales reside.\nExample 7-23 shows only one form and a few options for the localedef\ncommand. The localedef(1) reference page is a complete description of the\ncommand. The following is a summary of some important rules and options:\ne If you defined methods for your locale, you must specify the methods\nfile with the -m option. For example, the command line that builds the\nja_JP.sdeckanji locale would indude-m sdeckanji.mtoidentify\nthe file shown in Example 7-22.\ne You can use the -v option to run the command in verbose mode for\ndebugging purposes.

The following example shows\nhow you can work around this problem by assigning the standard locale\nname to the LANG variable and the name of your variant locale to the locale\ncategory variables.

Select a character by choosing the Character item from the Edit menu.\nThe cedit program prompts you to enter the hexadecimal code value\n(without the \\x prefix) for the character to be edited. The range of valid\ncodes for UDC characters is defined in a set of configuration files. When\nmore than one codeset is supported for the language and territory of\nyour current locale, cedit attempts to supply values for the additional\ncodesets so the character can be used with all the associated locales.\nIf cedit cannot determine the character’s value in other codesets, you\ncan change the codeset setting through the Options menu and then\nexplicitly specify the character’s encoding in the additional codeset. In\ngeneral, it is a good idea to define user-defined characters to have values\nthat can be mapped to other codesets supported for the language. F or\nmore information on codes for user-defined characters in specific Asian\nlanguages, refer to the language-specific technical reference guides\navailable on the Tru64 UNIX documentation CD-ROM.\nThe cedit utility first searches your current UDC database for the code\nthat you enter.

A module is a\nsingle body of code and text that can be assembled and compiled as a unit.\nA procedure is modular if it contains all the definitions and calls it needs to\nperform a task. A modular procedure must also follow rules and principles that\npermit it to be successfully linked with other procedures that follow the same\nrules and principles.\nThis chapter briefly discusses:\ne« Programming benefits of modular procedures\ne« The way to invoke modular procedures\n¢« The use of procedure libraries\ne Existing OpenVMS system procedures\n¢« The use of translated images\n1.1 Why Bother with Modular Procedures?\nProcedures can be combined to form programs in the following ways:\n¢« Your procedure calls other procedures.\n¢ Other procedures call your procedure.\n¢ A calling program calls either your procedure or other procedures.\nFor procedures to execute successfully when they are combined to form a\nprogram, they must follow general guidelines. Modular procedures that do not\nfollow these guidelines can cause other procedures in the program image to\nexecute incorrectly.\nThe modular programming guidelines in this manual are designed to give\nprogrammers a common environment in which to write code. If all programmers\nfollow these guidelines, then any modular procedure can be added to a procedure\nlibrary without conflicting with procedures already in the library or with any that\nare added later.\nModular programming offers the following advantages:\n« You can use any modular procedure in any program.\n¢ You can add a modular procedure to a library at any time.\ne You do not need to rewrite common algorithms for a new program.\ne You can reduce development time and complexity, and increase reliability.\nIntroduction to Modular Procedures 1-1\n\nIntroduction to Modular Procedures\n1.1 Why Bother with Modular Procedures?\ne« You can modify or replace a procedure without modifying the calling\nprogram, provided that you adhere to the guidelines for maintaining upward\ncomp", "start_char": 15600, "end_char": 17800}

If you\nare using a high-level language, the compiler generates the appropriate transfer\ninstruction when you use the conventions required by your language to implement\na procedure.\nFor more information about calling sequences, refer to OpenVMS Programming\nInterfaces: Calling a Systen Routine To find out how specific languages\nimplement procedures, refer to the documentation set for your language\nprocessor.\n1.3 Using Procedure Libraries\nYou can use modular procedures for general programming, or you can group them\nin procedure libraries. Grouping procedures into libraries is a way of collecting\nprocedures so that calling programs can access them easily. When you link your\nprogram to a library, the OpenVMS Linker utility (linker) automatically searches\nthat library to resolve any references that your program makes to procedures in\nthe library. Because the linker searches the specified library automatically, your\nprogram can call many modular procedures without including the name of each\nprocedure explicitly in the LINK command. The program's executable image and\nthe procedures that it calls are executed in the proper sequence at run time.\nFigure 1-1 show", "start_char": 17550, "end_char": 19750}

The program's executable image and\nthe procedures that it calls are executed in the proper sequence at run time.\nFigure 1-1 shows the development of a program that calls one or more procedures\nin a library. Depending on the options you select when writing modular\nprocedures, you can control the way the linker accesses your procedures, and\ntherefore, the way procedures are invoked at run time. For example, if you place\ncommonly used procedures within a shareable procedure library or shareable\nimage library, you can save memory and disk space because all user processes\ncan access a single copy of the shared procedures.\n1—2 Introduction to Modular Procedures\n\nIntroduction to Modular Procedures\n1.3 Using Procedure Libraries\nFigure 1-1 Developing a Program That Calls Library Procedures\nInteractive Input\nEditor\nEdit Time\nSource\nModule(s)\nYou edit and enter\nthe program.\nFILENAM.XXX\nLanguage\nTranslator Compile Time\nor\nAssembler Module(s) Compiler translates\nedited program into\nan object file.\nModule\nLibrary\nFILENAM.LIS\nLink Time\nThe linker searches\nobject module library and\nshareable images.\nShareable\nExecutable\nImage\nImage(s) The appropriate library\nentry points are made\nFILENAM.EXE known to the object\nmodule to form an\nexecutable image.\nRun FILENAM.EXE Y\nFILENAM.MAP\nRun Time\nShareable\nThe executable image\nis now aware of the\naddresses of the relevant\nCalled Program library procedures in\nObject Output its virtual address space.\nThe image can call library\nModules procedures at run time.\nExecutable\nImage(s)\nZK-4068-GE\n1.4 Existing System Procedures\nThe OpenVMS operating system includes many system routines that perform\nadvanced applications. These procedures are designed to perform various general\nfunctions and can be useful building blocks for your own procedures. Before\nyou write a new procedure, make sure the application does not already exist.\nYou should call an existing procedure from a system library whenever possible,\ninstead of duplicating code.\nIntroduction to Modular Procedures 1-3\n\nIntroduction to Modular Procedures\n1.4 Existing System Proc", "start_char": 19500, "end_char": 21700}

A single application can include both\nnative images (those that were recompiled and relinked) and translated images.\nThe most effective way to convert a program that runs on a VAX system to one\nthat runs on an Alpha system is to recompile the source code using a native\nAlpha compiler, and then to relink the object files and shareable images using the\nlinker.\nThe alternative method, translation, involves using DECmigrate for OpenVMS\nAlpha, which supports the migration of VAX applications to Alpha applications\nby translating images. DECmigrate converts VAX images into functionally\nequivalent images that can run on Alpha systems.

An\napplication should be made up of one or more files, each containing one or more\nprocedures. When linked, the procedures are organized into program sections\n(PSECTs). Each procedure, as well as the interface between the procedures,\nshould conform to the modular guidelines described in this manual.\n2.1.1 Organizing Files and Modules\nEach application contains one or more files. Each file contains exactly one\nmodule. For information about naming files, refer to Section 3.1.1.3. For\ninformation about naming modules, refer to Section 3.1.1.4.\n2.1.2 Organizing Procedures into Modules\nEach module should contain a single procedure or a group of related procedures.\nThe linker always brings the entire module containing a called procedure into the\nimage if any of its entry points are referenced. Therefore, placing each procedure\nin a separate module reduces image size and allows more flexibility when using a\nprocedure library. You can supply your own version of one procedure while using\nother procedures from the library. If many procedures have been grouped in a\nsingle module, the linker must link all or none of them.\nGroup procedures into a module if they share t", "start_char": 23400, "end_char": 25600}

To clarify the\ninteractions between procedures and programs, you must define each argument\nwhen you are designing a procedure. There are two types of arguments: explicit\narguments and implicit arguments. The following sections define explicit and\nimplicit arguments and describe how to use them.\n2.2.1 Explicit Arguments\nExplicit arguments are a procedure's primary interface with other programs.\nTherefore, to maintain a modular interface, you must follow the rules for\nargument order, data types, and passing mechanisms. The following format is\nused to describe each argument:\nargument-name\nOpenVMS usage: argument-data-structure\ntype: argument-data-type\naccess: argument-access\nmechanism: argument-passing-mechanism\nFor descriptions of each of these four argument attributes, see the OpenVMS\nProgramming Interfaces: Calling a System Routine!.\nTo make your procedures easier to call, be sure that the passing mechanism\nused for particular data types is consistent throughout all procedures in a\nfacility. Passing all atomic data by reference and all string data by descriptor is\nrecommended.\n2.2.2 Implicit Arguments\nAn implicit argument is one that is not specified in the argument list. Implicit\narguments provide additional information to your procedure from static storage\nlocations. Two types of implicit arguments are:\ne« Arguments allocated by the calling program\n¢« Arguments allocated by your procedure\nUsing implicit arguments is di", "start_char": 27300, "end_char": 29500}

If your procedure must retain\ninformation from previous activations, see Section 2.2.3 for ways to avoid using\nimplicit arguments.\n2.2.2.1 Implicit Arguments Allocated by the Calling Program\nThe calling program can allocate implicit arguments as statically allocated\nvariables in a named PSECT (for example, COMMON and MAP in BASIC,\nCOMMON in FORTRAN, or variables declared in the outer block of a procedure\nor program in Pascal). The calling program can also allocate implicit arguments\nas statically allocated global variables (for example, symbols defined with a\ndouble colon [::] in MACRO and GLOBAL variables in BLISS).\nAllocation of implicit arguments by the calling program is not recommended for\nthe following reasons:\n*« Two programs could use the same PSECT name or global variable for different\nvalues. This error would be undetected.\n1 This manual has been archived but is available on the OpenVMS Documentation\nCD-ROM.\n2-4 Designing Modular Procedures\n\nDesigning Modular Procedures\n2.2 Defining a Modular Procedure Interface\n¢« The calling program is no longer independent of the called procedure.\nConsequently, a change in one could inadvertently affect the other.\n« In FORTRAN, the calling program declares all variables as COMMON\nregardless of the number of implicit inputs actually needed. All COMMON\nvariables should also be declared by all modules that use the COMMON\nstorage, further decreasing independence.\n2.2.2.2 Implicit Arguments Allocated by the Called Procedure\nImplicit arguments allocated by the called procedure are kept in local static\nstorage.\nThese implicit arguments are usually used to keep track of resources (using\nresource allocating procedures) and shorten the explicit argument list.

However,\nthe use of implicit inputs by non-resource-allocating procedures can lead to\nunexpected results. For example, assume that procedure A is to leave information\nfor a companion procedure B. This would result in B having both explicit inputs\n(from its caller) and implicit inputs (from A’s storage). Next, consider that a\ncalling program calls A, then calls procedure X, and finally calls B. For the calling\nprogram to get correct results from B, it must know that X (and any procedure\nthat X calls) did not make a call to A, because such a call would change the\nimplicit inputsA leaves for B.\nBecause one of the objectives of modular programming is to permit procedures\nto be combined arbitrarily without needing to understand each other's internal\nworkings, Compaq does not recommend using implicit arguments. The same\nproblems can occur with any non-resource-allocating procedure that leaves results\nfor itself as future implicit arguments.\n2.2.3 How to Avoid Using Implicit Arguments\nProcedures that do not allocate resources can be written in the following three\nways to avoid the implicit argument problems described in Section 2.2.2:\ne When one procedure obtains results from another, combine the two procedures\ninto a single call. (See Section 2.2.3.1.)\ne Provide a single call to an action routine that is supplied by the calling\nprogram part way through the procedure's execution. (See Section 2.2.3.2.)\n¢ Give the calling program responsibility for retaining information from\na procedure activation. This is done with an explicit argument. (See\nSection 2.2.3.3.)\n2.2.3.1. Combining Procedures\nOften, non-resource-allocating procedures can be combined into a single procedure\nthat returns all information explicitly in a single call.\nCompare Example 2-1 with Example 2-2 to see the effects of combining\nprocedures to avoid the use of implicit arguments.\nDesigning Modular Procedures 2-5\n\nDesigning Modular Procedures\n2.2 Defining a Modular Procedure Interface\nExample 2-1 FORTRAN Program Showing", "start_char": 31200, "end_char": 33400}

For this to\nhappen, your procedure must specify an action routine argument that is called\nduring execution. Therefore, your procedure can execute twice, before and after\nthe action routine, with no implicit inputs. The OPEN statements in BASIC,\nFORTRAN, and Pascal use this technique by permitting the user to supply a\nuser-action routine.\nTo keep the calling program from having to provide implicit inputs for its action\nroutine, your procedure should also provide another argument that is passed to\nthe action routine.

There are three ways to do this:\nRequire the calling program to allocate the storage your procedure needs.\nThen have the calling program pass the address of the storage location as\nan explicit argument on all calls to your procedure. The disadvantage of this\nmethod is that you cannot increase the amount of storage needed by your\nprocedure without requiring all calling programs to be rewritten. Thus, you\nshould use this method only when you are confident that your procedure will\nnot be revised to use additional storage in the future.\nRequire the calling program to allocate a longword pointer to the stored\ndata and pass its address to your procedure as an explicit argument. On\nthe first call, your called procedure will dynamically allocate storage (by\ncalling LIB$GET_VM) and store its address in the caller’s longword.

MTH$RANDOM returns a random number\nbetween 0 and 1 and updates the longword seed passed by the calling program.\nThis ensures that the procedure will generate a different value on the next call.\nThe next two sections describe interface techniques that permit storage size to\nchange without affecting the interface with the calling program.\n2-8 Designing Modular Procedures\n\nDesigning Modular Procedures\n2.2 Defining a Modular Procedure Interface\nCalling Program Passes Pointer\nIn this method, the calling program", "start_char": 37050, "end_char": 39250}

It then passes the\naddress of the longword as an explicit argument. The following two interface\ntechniques can be used to indicate that storage is to be initialized:\ne Provide a single entry point. If your called procedure finds the value zero in\nthe longword that the calling program has allocated, the procedure allocates\nand initializes dynamic heap storage.\ne Provide a second entry point. This entry point stores the address of the\nallocated storage in the longword. On subsequent calls, your procedure uses\nthat value as the storage address of information from previous calls.\nRegardless of the method used to indicate storage allocation and initialization,\nyou must also provide a way to indicate storage deallocation. You can do this by\nusing either a separate argument or separate entry point.\nFor example, the procedure LIB$INIT_TIMER, which gets times and counts from\nthe operating system, uses a single optional argument handle-adr to determine\nwhere these values are to be stored. The handle-adr argument is the address of\na longword pointing to a block of storage that contains the values of times and\ncounts:\n¢ 1|f handle-adr is missing, the values are stored in static storage, making this\ncall non-AST-reentrant.\ne If handle-adr is zero, LIB$INIT_TIMER allocates a block of dynamic heap\nstorage by calling LIB$GET_VM. The values are placed in that block, and the\naddress of the block is returned in handle-adr.\n¢ 1f handle-adr is nonzero, it is considered to be the address of a storage block\npreviously allocated by a call to LIB$INIT_TIMER. The block is then used\nagain, and new times and counts are stored in it.\nLIB$FREE_TIMER deallocates the block of dynamic heap storage allocated by a\nprevious call to LIB$INIT_TIMER.

That storage is returned\nto free storage by calling LIB$FREE_ VM.\nCalling Program Passes a Processwide Identifier\nIn this method, the calling program passes a processwide identifying value to\nidentify implicit results produced on previous calls, which will be implicit inputs\non this call. Any calling program can use the processwide identifier. Examples\ninclude BASIC or FORTRAN logical unit numbers and OpenVMS system services\n1/O channel numbers.\nProcesswide identifiers are a resource. Modular programming techniques require\nthat all resources allocated by a procedure be allocated by calling a resource-\nallocating procedure. This prevents conflicts because a single procedure can keep\ntrack of multiple allocations to more than one procedure or procedure activation.\nTherefore, if you use the method described in this section, you will also have\nto write a resource-allocating procedure to control the resource If you write a\nresource-allocating procedure, it is recommended that you place it in an object\nmodule library so that other programmers can use it.\nThe library procedures LIB$GET_LUN and LIB$FREE_LUN allocate and\ndeallocate FORTRAN and BASIC logical unit numbers outside the range normally\nspecified in user programs, that is, outside the range 0 to 99.\nDesigning Modular Procedures 2-9\n\nDesigning Modular Procedures\n2.2 Defining a Modular Procedure Interface\n2.2.4 Order of Arguments\nProcedures in the RTL follow a consistent pattern for positioning arguments.

Optional output arguments (write access)\nNote that optional arguments follow required arguments. Therefore, when the\ncalling program omits the optional arguments, the actual argument list passed to\nthe procedure is shortened.\nThe called procedure accesses the required arguments from left to right,\nbeginning with the first argument. The only exceptions are procedures that\nreturn a large function value of known size. In this case, the calling program\nuses the first argument to specify where the function value is to be stored, and\nthe other arguments are shifted right one position. (For more information, refer\nto the OpenVMS Calling Standard.)\n2.2.5 Using Optional Arguments\nAn optional argument is one that the calling program can omit. The calling\nprogram indicates the omission by passing argument list entries containing zero.\nFor a trailing optional argument, the calling program can pass a shortened list or\na zero argument list entry.\nA zero argument list entry is simply a zero passed to the procedure by value. For\nexample, if we call a procedure called GRA_CUBE and omit an optional argument\nC, the calling sequence from BASIC would be as follows:\n15 CALL GRA_CUBE(A, B, 0 BY VALUE)\nIn this call, O BY VALUE is the zero argument list entry.\nNote\nMost OpenVMS system services, unlike the run-time library procedures,\ncannot accept a shortened argument list. Omitted arguments must\nalways be indicated with a zero argument list entry. For arguments\npassed by value, there is no distinction between passing a zero value and\npassing a zero argument list entry.\n2.3 JSB Entry Points (VAX Only)\nOn VAX systems, Compag recommends that you do not use J]S B? entry points\nin procedures that will be contained in a procedure library.

Efficient use of system\nresources makes more resources available for all processes.\n2.4.1 Choosing a Storage Type\nThere are three types of storage: stack, heap, and static. The three forms of\nstorage differ in the method and duration of allocation, that is, how long that\nstorage is in use.\n2.4.1.1 Stack Storage\nA procedure dynamically allocates stack storage on the process stack at run time,\nas needed. To allocate stack storage, the procedure moves the stack pointer up by\ndecreasing its value. Note that stack storage is not initialized to zero because the\nstack is created once and reused many times for subsequent stack frames.\nThe procedure deallocates stack storage by moving the stack pointer down\n(increasing its value) when that procedure returns control to the calling program.\nStack storage exists only for the duration of the procedure activation that creates\nit.\n2.4.1.2 Heap Storage\nDynamic heap storage is allocated at run time from a processwide pool, as the\nprocedure activation needs it and as the account quotas and virtual address space\nof your process permits.\nTo allocate heap storage, your procedure calls a system routine such as the Run-\nTime Library procedure LIB$GET_VM or the system service $E XPREG.

The system service $CNTREG cannot be used to deallocate heap\nstorage.\nFigure 2-4 shows how the different types of storage are used.\nNote\nThe type of storage to be used can be determined by the duration or\nquantity of the storage. Any storage that is of long duration and unknown\nquantity (at compile time) should be heap storage.

(InN some cases, you may need to use mailbox I/O and network operations.\nFor information about these areas, see the DECne@ for OpeVMS Networking\nManual.) Regardless of whether you are directing input/output to the terminal\nscreen or to a file, you must follow two rules to maintain modularity:\n2-14 Designing Modular Procedures\n\nDesigning Modular Procedures\n2.5 Using Input/Output\n1. A procedure must not print error or informational messages either directly or\nby calling the $PUTMSG system service.

However, $QIOs\nuse device-dependent services and are the most difficult to use from high-\nlevel languages of all methods discussed here, because there are more steps\ninvolved and because the calling interface requires more knowledge from\nthe caller than RMS services. Using a $QIO in your procedure may require\nadditional steps, such as constructing item lists, writing AST routines,\nassigning an I/O channel, queueing an I/O request, testing to ensure that\nthe request was successfully queued and completed, and deassigning the\n1/O channel. (For more information about $QIOs, see the OpenVMS System\nServices Reference Manual.)\nOpenVMS Record Management Services (RMS)\nThe RMS facility provides device-independent and general-purpose services\nthat are easier to call than $QIOs. However, it is often not convenient to\nconstruct the access control blocks (FAB, RAB, and so forth) required by\nRMS from a high-level language. (For more information about RMS, see the\nOpenVMS Record Management Services Reference Manual.)\nLanguage |/O statements\nLanguage I/O statements are provided for all high-level languages. These\nstatements are easy to use and provide simple |/O and data formatting\nfor the high-level language user. Native language I/O statements make it\nunnecessary for the high-level language user to call $QIO or RMS directly;\nthese calls are made by the compiled code on your behalf. However, low-level\nand medium-level languages (VAX MACRO and BLISS-32) have no built-in\nlanguage I/O statements and must use $QIO and RMS for terminal and file\n1/O. (For more information, see the appropriate language reference manual.)\nScreen Management Procedures in the run-time library (SMG$)\nSMG$ procedures provide an easy-to-call interface for high-level languages.\nThey are device independent and aid in the composition of complex\nscreen images. The SMG¢$ facility in the run-time library provides screen\ncomposition operations; that is, SMG$ makes it easy for an application to\ndivide its screen into multiple regions and provides functions for manipulating\nthose regions.

For example, an |/O\nprocedure may write something to the terminal screen that the calling program\nwants to erase. To erase it, the calling program must know both what and\nwhere that information is. The calling program and the called procedure must\ncommunicate by passing arguments that define which part of the screen will be\naccessed by each. The run-time library contains Screen Management (SMG$)\nprocedures for this purpose.\nDo not combine different methods of I/O within your application. Problems\ncan arise if the calling program and the called procedure use different methods\nof 1/O. Each method of performing input/output maintains some knowledge of\nwhat is on the terminal screen. At the very least, the current cursor position is\nremembered. If another type of I/O is performed, that information is not updated\nand, therefore, becomes incorrect. The results of any subsequent I/O would be\nunpredictable. If you must combine other methods with uses of SMG$ procedures,\nuse the SMG¢$ procedures that aid such an integration.\n2.5.2 File Input/Output\nFile |/O can be performed by the following methods:\n¢ Block I/O\nUses system services to map a section of the file to the process virtual address\nspace.

Checking the return status of a called procedure for repetitive\ncalls can be time consuming and adversely affect the performance of the calling\nprogram. For example, if you are going to call a procedure 100 times within a\nloop and the chances of that procedure’s failure are small, you may not want to\ntake the time to check the return status after each call to make sure that the\ncondition value returned was SS$ NORMAL. Signaling error conditions is far\nmore efficient in this type of application.\nFrom the point of view of the calling program, handling a signaled condition\nis slightly more difficult than checking a returned condition value because it\ninvolves writing a condition handler to be invoked in the event that an error\ncondition is signaled. However, handling a signaled condition allows the calling\nprogram to execute more efficiently.\nTo signal an error condition, your procedure uses either a condition-handling\nmechanism provided by the source language, or it calls the Run-Time Library\nprocedure LIB$SIGNAL. To use LIB$SIGNAL, your procedure calls LIB$SIGNAL\nand specifies the condition code and zero or more arguments specifying the\nenvironment of the condition. For more information about using LIB$SIGNAL,\nsee the OpenVMS RTL Library (LIB$) Manual.\n2-20 Designing Modular Procedures\n\nDesigning Modular Procedures\n2.7 Planning for Signaling and Condition Handling\n2.7.2 Guidelines for Returning Condition Values\nFrom the point of view of the calling program, it is much easier to check returned\ncondition values than to handle signaled error conditions.

Compaq\nrecommends that you return condition values when the explanation of the error\ncondition is simple and self-contained. For example, LIB$GET_VM returns a\ncondition value, because the possible status conditions are self-contained and\nsimple (for example, insufficient virtual memory).\nAccording to the OpenVMS Calling Standard, the status returned must be a\ncondition value. (For more information, see OpenVMS Programming Interfaces:\nCalling a System Routine!.\n2.7.3 When to Signal or Return Condition Values\nTo some degree, whether you decide to signal an error condition or return a\ncondition value depends on the language you are using for your procedure.\nIn some high-level languages, it is difficult to write a condition handler to be\ninvoked in the event that an error condition is signaled. (For more information\nabout condition handling in your language, consult the appropriate language\nreference manual.)\nRegardless of which language you are using, there are general guidelines for\nwhen to return a condition value and when to signal an error condition.\nYou should signal an error condition in the following situations:\n¢ Your procedure returns a value in RO and cannot return a condition value.\n¢« Your procedure must execute quickly, and checking the return status of a\ncondition value would be inefficient.\ne Your procedure will be executed repetitively; therefore, checking the condition\nvalue returned would adversely affect your procedure’s performance.\ne« The amount of information you want to return about the error condition\ncannot be contained in a condition value.\n¢« A useful error message requires information that cannot be determined until\nrun time.

Specifically, it covers the\nfollowing topics:\n¢ Coding guidelines\ne —[nitializing modular procedures\ne Writing AST-reentrant code\nAppendix A summarizes many of these guidelines. Refer to the appendix to\nreview the guidelines, or use it as a checklist.\n3.1 Coding Guidelines\nThe coding guidelines discussed in this section are of two types: required and\nrecommended. You must follow the sections marked required to ensure that\nyour application is modular. Compag highly recommends that you adhere to\nthe guidelines presented in the sections marked recommended. Following these\nadditional rules will help you produce consistent, uniform applications.\n3.1.1 Adhering to the Naming Conventions\nThe following guidelines apply to the naming of facilities, procedures, files,\nmodules, and program sections.

Providing related procedures with a\ncommon facility prefix is a convenient method for organizing procedures. The\nfacility prefix is the first part of any procedure name.\nAs shown in Figure 3-1, the first three (or sometimes four) characters of a\nprocedure name are used to indicate the facility of a run-time library (RTL)\nprocedure.\nCoding Modular Procedures 3-1\n\nCoding Modular Procedures\n3.1 Coding Guidelines\nFigure 3-1 Examples of Facility Prefixes As Used in Procedure Names\nSTR$APPEND BASS$STRING\nFacility Prefix Facility Prefix\nfor String Manipulation for BASIC—Specific Support\nProcedures Procedures\nZK-3084-GE\nFacility names represent library facilities.

The name for your facility should be a unique name between 1 and 27\ncharacters. Facility names supplied by Compaq all contain a dollar sign ($) after\nthe prefix. User-supplied facility names should use an underscore (_) rather than\na dollar sign ($) to avoid any name conflicts.\nThe facility number is used in defining condition values for the facility. Bit 27\n(STS$V_CUST_DEF) of a condition value indicates whether the value is supplied\nby Compaq or by the user. This bit must be 1 if the facility number is created\nby the user. For more information, use the Help Message utility (MSGHLP) to\naccess online descriptions of system messages from the DCL ($) prompt. For\nmore information about using MSGHLP, refer to the OpenVMS System Messages:\nCompanion Guide for Hap Message Users.\n3.1.1.2 Procedure Naming Conventions (Recommended)\nWhen you create a procedure and make its name global, you allow other\nprocedures in the same image to call that procedure. The common RTL\nprocedures are examples of procedures with global names. In such an\nenvironment, a naming convention is required to prevent any name conflict\nbetween global procedures in the same image.\nThe rules for naming entry points to procedures have the following general form:\n¢ fac$symbol (Compaq supplied)\ne fac_symbol (user-supplied)\nwhere:\nfac is a two- to four-character facility name.\nsymbol is a symbol from 1 to 27 characters long. (The entire procedure name may\nnot exceed 31 characters in length.)\nThe facility name and symbol name are separated by a dollar sign ($) if the\nprocedure is supplied by Compaq and by an underscore (_) if the procedure is\nsupplied by the user.

This convention should be used to avoid conflict between\nCompaq and user procedure names.\nThe procedure name usually consists of a verb and an object that together\ndescribe the action of the procedure. For example, the Run-Time Library\nprocedure intended to get virtual memory is called LIB$GET_ VM.\nSome procedures, even though they have global names, are not intended to be\ncalled from outside the facility in which they are located. These procedures are\nonly available internally, within a set of procedures, and do not by themselves\nprovide any functionality for the facility. The names for these procedures contain\na double dollar sign ($$) if they are supplied by Compaq or a triple underscore\n(____) if they are supplied by the user. (Three underscores are necessary\nCoding Modular Procedures 3-3\n\nCoding Modular Procedures\n3.1 Coding Guidelines\nto avoid conflict with user-defined condition value symbols, which use two\nunderscores.)\nTable 3-2 shows examples of procedure entry point names.\nTable 3-2 Naming Procedure Entry Points\nProcedure Name Description\nLIB$GET_VM Compaq supplied global procedure\nLIB_PRINT_REPORT User-supplied global procedure\nOTS$$INTERNAL Compaq supplied internal procedure\nLIB_ = ADD_TAX User-supplied internal procedure\n3.1.1.3 File Naming Conventions (Recommended)\nYou should derive your file name from the names of the procedures contained in\nthe module that comprises the file.\nIf a module contains a single procedure, the file name consists of the procedure\nname. You can remove dollar signs and underscores, but this is not required. File\ntypes are the standard default file types for the source language. For example,\nthe file containing the RTL procedure MTH$EXP is named MTHEXP.MAR.\nThis name makes it obvious that the file MTHEXP.MAR contains the procedure\nMTH$EXP and is written in VAX MACRO.\nSometimes, the module comprising the file will contain more than one procedure.\nFor example, the RTL procedures LIB$GET_VM and LIB$FREE_VM are\ncontained in", "start_char": 76050, "end_char": 78250}

In this case, a more\ngeneral file name is used, composed of the facility prefix (LIB) and the first nouns\ncommon to all procedure names in the module (VM ). Thus, the name for the file\ncontaining procedures LIB$GET_VM and LIB$FREE_VM is LIBVM.B32. (The\nfile type B32 indicates that the module is written in VAX BLISS-32.)\n3.1.1.4 Module Naming Conventions (Required)\nModule names are identical to file names except that module names do not have\nextensions, and the dollar sign ($) or underscore (_ ), which separates the facility\nprefix and symbol name, is not removed.\nFor example, the MTH$EXP procedure is contained in module MTH$EXP and\nthe fille MTHEXP.MAR. The LIB$GET_VM and LIB$FREE_VM procedures are\ncontained in the module LIB$VM and the file LIBVM.B32.\n3.1.1.5 PSECT Naming Conventions (Required)\nThe code and data sections of a customer library procedure have two separate\nprogram sections (PSECTS), named fac CODE and _fac DATA, where fac is the\nfacility name. Compaq uses _fac$CODE and _fac$DATA as PSECT names.\nPosition-independent constant data is in the PSECT named fac CODE\n(_fac$CODE for Compaq) to shorten the references. For example,\n_LIB$CODE and _LIB$DATA are the only two PSECT names used by LIB$\nprocedures.\nThe collating sequence for leading underscores causes the linker to place all\nlibrary procedures after the user program in the executable image. This prevents\na library procedure from being placed between two user modules and adversely\naffecting any byte or word displacement addressing contained in the user\nprograms.\n3-4 Coding Modular Procedures\n\nCoding Modular Procedures\n3.1 Coding Guidelines\nNot all languages give you control over PSECT names.

Procedures that call nonmodular system services are nonmodular\nthemselves. If your procedure uses a nonmodular system service, you should\nlist the system service in the Side Effects section of the procedure description.\n(For information about the procedure description, see Section 2.6.2.) For more\ninformation about specific system services and modularity, see the OpenVMS\nSystem Services Reference M anual.\n3.1.4 Invoking Optional User-Action Routines\nAn optional user-action routine is a useful way to let the calling program gain\ncontrol at a critical point in your procedure’s algorithm. Success routines and\nerror routines are the most common user-action routines. Control is passed from\nyour procedure to the optional error routine if the specified error is encountered\nwithin your procedure. To transfer control, the calling program must pass the\nuser-action routine as an argument to the called procedure. To make it easy\nfor the calling program to pass information to its action routine, your procedure\nshould supply an optional user-arg argument that the calling program can pass\nto its action routine. Your procedure merely copies the argument list entry of the\nuser argument, if present, to the argument list it passes to the action routine.\nThis achieves the same effect as up-level addressing.\nCoding Modular Procedures 3-7\n\nCoding Modular Procedures\n3.1 Coding Guidelines\n3.1.4.1 Bound Procedure Value (VAX Only)\nOn VAX systems, the bound procedure value (DSC$K_DTYPE_BPV) is used by\nCompag Pas", "start_char": 83850, "end_char": 86050}

The procedure might do up-level addressing of a variable defined in a\nsyntactically outer block and allocated in another frame. (If you use a procedure\nentry mask, this context is specified in the user-arg argument.)\nFor a bound procedure value passed by reference, the argument list entry\ncontains the address of two longwords. The first longword contains the address\nof the procedure, and the second contains the environment pointer to be loaded\ninto R1 before the procedure is called. This environment pointer allows you to\nspecify the context of your action routine enabling you to do up-level addressing.\nTo provide a user-action routine using the bound procedure value passed by\nreference, the calling sequence is as follows:\nCALL myproc [action-routine [,user-arg]]\nIn this example, action-routine is a function call of the bound procedure value\ntype that is passed by reference, and user-arg is unspecified.\nIf you want to use the bound procedure value data type to pass access to a user\nroutine specified as a procedure entry mask, you must pass the first longword by\nvalue and omit the second longword. Then, the user-action routine would have\nthis calling sequence:\nstatus = action-routine (...[,user-arg])\nIn this example, status is a longword condition value that is passed by value,\nand user-arg is unspecified. Your procedure copies the 32-bit argument list entry\npassed by the calling program to the argument list provided to the action routine\nTherefore, the calling program and its action routine can communicate using any\ndata type, access type, passing mechanism, or OpenVMS usage.\n3.2 Initializing Modular Procedures\nSome modular procedures must initialize themselves before they can execute\ncorrectly.

Also,\nyou would have to rewrite your calling programs if you needed to substitute a\nprocedure with an initialization call for one without an initialization call.\nIf your procedure uses LIB$INITIALIZE, you must preserve a modular\nenvironment that does not conflict with the environment set by any other\nprocedure using LIB$INITIALIZE.

In some\nlanguages, you do not need to explicitly initialize static storage. These languages\nautomatically initialize static storage to zero. To see if the language you are\nusing initializes static storage implicitly, refer to your reference manual for that\nlanguage.\nThere are three ways to explicitly initialize storage: you can use an initialization\nstatement, test and set a first-time flag at run time, or use LIB$INITIALIZE. The\nmethod of testing and setting a first-time flag is explained in Section 3.3.4.2.\nFigure 3-3 shows examples of how languages supported by the OpenVMS\noperating system initialize a longword, DAT, in static storage using an\ninitialization statement.\nCoding Modular Procedures 3-9\n\nCoding Modular Procedures\n3.2 Initializing Modular Procedures\n3.2.2 Testing and Setting a First-Time Flag\nTo do first-time initialization, your procedure can test and then set to onea\nstatically allocated first-time flag each time it is called. This flag is initialized to\nzero at compile or link time.\nSetting and testing the flag with the RTL procedure LIB$BBSSI, a Branch\non Bit Set and Set (BBSS) VAX instruction, or a Branch on Bit Set and Set\nInterlocked (VAX BBSSI) instruction, ensures that initialization is executed\nexactly once. (Some high-level languages provide semantics for accessing these\nVAX instructions: for instance, the BBSSI built-in for C.)\nHowever, if your implementation language does not have access to VAX\ninstructions and the procedure is to be AST (Asynchronous System Trap)\nreentrant, it must follo", "start_char": 89700, "end_char": 91900}

An example of a value that you may need to initialize at\nrun time is a seed for a random number generator.\nTo use LIB$INITIALIZE to initialize a value at run time, you must do the\nfollowing:\n1. Write the main program.\n2. Write an initialization procedure.\n3. Write a MACRO or BLISS program to add the address of that initialization\nprocedure to PSECT LIB$INITIALIZE.\n4. Compile the initialization procedure, main program, and MACRO program.\n5. Link the initialization procedure, main program, and MACRO program.\n6. Run the main program.\nAssuming that you have completed the main program, first you must write an\ninitialization procedure. If, for example, you are going to use LIB$INITIALIZE\nto initialize a value for a random number generator, you might write an\ninitialization procedure to set the seed equal to the current time. This would\ngenerate a different seed for each initialization because the time is constantly\nchanging. One possible initialization procedure is shown in Example 3-2.\nOnce you have defined the initialization procedure, you must write the\nMACRO program to add the address of that initialization procedure to PSECT\nLIBSINITIALIZE. The format for this MACRO program is simple, as seen in\nExample 3-3.\nTo modify this MACRO program for use in your own procedures, substitute the\nname of your initialization procedure for MY_INIT_ROUTINE.\nCoding Modular Procedures 3-13\n\nCoding Modular Procedures\n3.2 Initializing Modular Procedures\nExample 3-2 BASIC Initialization Procedure for LIBSINITIALIZE\n100 +\n!

If your procedure is not AST reentrant or calls any procedure that is\nnot, your program documentation should specify this to warn others against using\nyour procedure.\n3.3.1 What Is an AST?\nAn asynchronous system trap (AST) is an OpenVMS mechanism for providing\na software interrupt when an external event occurs. One example of this type\nof interrupt occurs when a user presses Ctrl/C. When the external event occurs,\nthe OpenVMS operating system interrupts the execution of the current process\nand calls a procedure that you supply. This procedure is referred to as the AST\nhandler.\nSome OpenVMS system services let an external event interrupt a process.\nBecause the interrupt occurs out of sequence with respect to process execution,\nthe interrupt mechanism is called an asynchronous system trap. The AST\ninterrupt transfers control to the AST handler that services the event. This AST\nhandler can call other procedures, including library procedures.\nThe AST handler you provide and any procedures it calls are said to be executing\nat AST level. While at AST level, a process cannot be interrupted a second time\nat the same access mode. The process runs to completion at the AST level before\nthe non-AST level procedure resumes.\nA process is executing either at AST level or at non-AST level and thus consists\nof two threads of execution, one thread at each level. Keep in mind that these\nlevels are threads of the same process and not separate processes.\nWhen your AST handler finishes servicing the event, it returns control to\nits caller. The interrupted procedure continues execution from the point of\ninterruption.\nFor example, you could call the Set Timer system service ($SETIMR) to specify\nthe address of an AST-level procedure to be executed after a specified amount of\ntime has elapsed.

Full\nreentrancy refers to a more restrictive set of conditions.\nIn an AST-reentrant environment, the AST thread is expected to complete\nregardless of whether it encounters a locked resource. When the AST thread\nencounters a locked resource in an AST-reentrant environment, it expects to be\ngiven a new resource, or else it is expected to return an error message. It is never\nexpected to wait for the resource that the non-AST level has locked.\nIn a fully reentrant environment, all threads are treated equally when they\nencounter a locked resource; they wait for the resource to be freed. In a fully\nreentrant environment, AST threads are not given any special treatment. The\nCompag Ada environment is an example of a fully reentrant environment. In\nsuch a situation, there can be more than two threads of concurrent execution, and\neach thread can alternately progress toward an end.\nNote\nIt is highly desirable that future code satisfy the more stringent\nrequirement of being fully reentrant. Full reentrancy is important\nfor procedures that will be called from multithread environments, such as\nAda tasks.

An AST handler can be written in any language. Because the particulars\nof writing an AST handler differ from one language to the next, see the reference\nmanual for the language you are working in for more details.\nIn general, an AST handler must follow these guidelines:\ne [It must be separate from the procedure that is currently executing.\ne [It must not modify data or instructions used by the interrupted procedure or\nits callers.\ne If it calls any other procedures, they must all be AST reentrant.\n¢ TheAST handler cannot stall or use busy wait to avoid being called before the\nnon-AST level is out of a critical section of code. Once the AST handler has\nbegun executing, it cannot be interrupted by anything at a non-AST level. In\nfact, the only thing that can interrupt the AST handler is another procedure\nrunning at AST level in a more privileged access mode.\nIf you attempt to use a busy wait and expect to change the condition from\nthe non-AST level, the AST level circles the busy wait in an infinite loop.\nThe process continues to loop because the non-AST level does not continue\nexecuting until the AST thread has finished and thus is never able to change\nthe value in the busy wait condition.\n3-16 Coding Modular Procedures\n\nCoding Modular Procedures\n3.3 Writing AST-Reentrant Code\n¢« You cannot use the lock manager to protect a resource being accessed at non-\nAST level from being accessed at AST level. The lock manager is designed\nto lock resources between separate processes, not different threads (AST and\nnon-AST) of the same process.\ne Avoid using static storage. A procedure that does not use static storage,\ncalls only AST-reentrant procedures, and does no up-level addressing is\nautomatically AST reentrant.\n3.", "start_char": 103350, "end_char": 105550}

A procedure that does not use static storage,\ncalls only AST-reentrant procedures, and does no up-level addressing is\nautomatically AST reentrant.\n3.3.4 How to Eliminate Race Conditions During Concurrent Access\nWhen using AST interrupts, you might encounter two problems: race conditions\nand deadlocks. A race condition occurs when your AST handler attempts to use a\nnonshareable resource already in use by the non-AST thread of execution.\nIf you allow the AST handler to wait for the resource (for example, by waiting\nfor an event flag to be set by the non-AST level code of the same access mode),\nyou have caused a form of deadlock. A deadlock occurs because the non-AST level\ncode cannot execute to free the resource until the AST-level code has finished\nexecuting. The AST level code cannot continue either, because the non-AST level\ncode has effectively locked the resource.\nA race condition occurs when you attempt to access or modify the same data in\nstatic storage by both the AST and non-AST levels of a process. For example,\nif an AST begins executing while the non-AST level is modifying data in static\nstorage, that data may be left in a nonstable state while the AST handler\nexecutes. To prevent a race condition, you should allow only one thread at a\ntime to modify data. Use atomic modify operations provided by your HLL, which\ncorrectly interlock such access.\nIf a procedure does not modify any static storage, it is both AST reentrant\nand fully reentrant. Your procedure can eliminate conflict when accessing and\nmodifying data in static storage by:\ne Detecting concurrency of access to data using test and set instructions at\nentry to and exit from data storage. The procedure may then report an error,\nor retry the operation (when appropriate) if concurrency is detected.\n¢ Keeping a call-in-progress count that is incremented when your procedure is\ncalled and decremented when it returns.

However, this method applies\nonly to the VAX MACRO assembly language, and even then does not apply to\nemulated instructions.\nFor example, you can use queue instructions to maintain a linked list in a single\ninstruction instead of modifying the forward and backward fields of the list in\nseveral instructions. You can use a single queue instruction at the beginning of\nyour procedure to remove one section, and another queue instruction at the end\nto insert the section back in the queue.\nWhile a section is removed from the queue, your procedure can modify data in\nit. If an AST interrupt occurs while the section is removed, a different section of\ndata is used instead, thus avoiding conflicts with the interrupted procedure.\nCoding Modular Procedures 3-17\n\nCoding Modular Procedures\n3.3 Writing AST-Reentrant Code\nExample 3-5 shows an AST-reentrant procedure that uses queue instructions to\ncontrol allocation of quadword blocks.\nExample 3-5 VAX MACRO Program Showing Use of Queue Instructions to\nPerform All Accesses in a Single Instruction\n.PSECT _LIB_DATA PIC, USR, CON, REL, LCL, NOSHR, NOEXRED,, W RT\nFLAG: .LONG 0 ; First-time flag@\nQ HED .LONG 0,0\n.PSECT _LIB_CODE PIC, USR, CON, REL, LCL, SHR, EXE, RD, NOWRT\n.ENTRY LIB_GET_X, “M<>\nBBC FLAG, FIRST ; Branch on Ist call only\nTRY: REMQUE @Q_HED, RO ; RO = address of queue\nBVS 10$ ; Branch if empty and fill\nRET\n10S: BSBB FILL ; Fill queues\nBRB TRY ; Try again\n; Here on first call only\n“<\nFIRST: S$SETAST #0 Disable ASTs, RO=old setting\nt\nBBSS FLAG, 20$ ; Branch if already set\nMOVAL Q_ HED, Q_HED ; Make queue empty\nMOVAL Q HED, Q_HED+4 ; Back pointer too\nBSBB FILL ; Fill queues\n208: CMPL #SS$_WASSET, RO ; were ASTs enabled before?\nBNEQ TRY ; No, leave disabled, retry\nSSETAST 1 ; Yes, enable ASTs\nBRB TRY ; Try again\nFILL: get space for 10 quadwords by calling L", "start_char": 107250, "end_char": 109450}

You can detect concurrent\naccess of static storage at both AST and non-AST levels by adding the following\nsteps to your procedures:\n1. Place a Branch on Bit Set and Set (BBSS or BBSSI) instruction immediately\nbefore your procedure accesses static storage. Or, use LIB$BBSSI or\nsemantics provided by your compiler.\n2.

Before database\naccess, the count is incremented and used as an index for an address table of the\nseparate databases. You should check for a count that exceeds the table length.\nAfter the database has been accessed, the count is decremented.\nThis technique has an advantage over the BBxx technique because it can handle\nmore than two levels of reentrance. However, it is less reliable because an\nexception can cause the count never to be decremented, leading to an eventual\nprocedure malfunction. You can avoid this by establishing a condition handler in\nyour procedure.\n3.3.4.4 Disabling AST Interrupts\nA procedure is also considered AST reentrant if AST interrupts are disabled\nwhile critical sections of code execute. However, Compaq does not recommend\nthis method of maintaining AST reentrancy.\nSometimes the only way to avoid race conditions is to disable AST interrupts\nduring the access to static storage, and restore the state of the AST enable once\nthe critical section of code has finished executing.

The busy\nbit is tested and set using a BBSS instruction before the RAB is accessed.\nIf the RAB is already busy, your procedure executes a $WAIT using that\nRAB.\nFor synchronous |/O (always completed before returning control to your\nprocedure), you can allocate the RAB in either of these ways.

To ensure successful testing,\nplan how to test your procedures while you are designing them, and begin testing\nwhile you are coding. You should test for the following:\n¢ Ensure that the procedure you developed fulfills your requirements or\nspecifications.\nCarefully test the functionality to ensure that the procedure does everything\nthat it is supposed to do. The methods you use to test this aspect of your\nprocedure depend upon the functions your procedure performs.\ne Ensure that the procedure is modular and executes without error.\nThis chapter focuses on testing procedures for modularity. Modularity is\nespecially important to procedures that will be included in a library facility. A\nprocedure that is not modular can adversely affect the results and performance of\nother procedures that call it.\nTo ensure modularity within procedures, perform at least the following tests:\ne« Unit testing\n« Language-independence testing\ne Integration testing\nThis chapter discusses methods for designing and administering these types of\ntests. It also describes reentrancy, performance analysis, and RTL procedures for\ntime and resource monitoring.\n4.1 Unit Testing\nBefore you begin combining units of code (Such as subprograms, subroutines, and\ninternal procedures) to form your new procedure, it is essential to ensure that\neach of these units works separately.

You must supply multiple\ntest values in cases of compound and nested loops. In testing the entry points,\nremember to invoke any optional routines (either internal or external), as\nwell as error handlers.

Providing for language independence is essential to\nproducing a useful procedure.\nTesting for language independence is a specific type of unit testing. It ensures\nthat your program executes correctly, regardless of the language from which it is\ncalled.\nTo test your procedures for language independence, write several driver programs\nin languages you have chosen randomly. The driver program need only contain a\ncall to the procedure being tested.\nIf you do find that your procedures are not language independent, make sure that\nthey conform to the following rules:\n¢ All atomic data must be passed by reference, and all strings must be passed\nby descriptor.\nAdherence to this single guideline is the most important fact", "start_char": 122850, "end_char": 125050}

Unit testing is\ndesigned to test each separate component. Depending on your procedure, that\ncomponent might be a module, a subprogram, a subroutine, an internal procedure\n(fac_____ name), or an intrinsic piece of code. Once you have determined that\neach unit works separately, you need to determine that the units also work\ntogether to form the complete procedure.\nIntegration testing can be completed by either of the two methods described in\nSection 4.3.1 and Section 4.3.2.\n4.3.1 All-at-Once Approach to Integration Testing\nOne method of integration testing is the all-at-once approach. In this method,\nyou finish all the units, link them, and test the completed structure all at once.\nCompag strongly discourages use of this method, because it makes it difficult to\nfind the location of errors. For example, look at the organization of the units in\nthe sample procedure shown in Figure 4-3. Assume that this procedure used the\nall-at-once approach and found an error; the procedure did not work. There is no\nway of knowing whether the error was in unit A, unit B, unit C, or unit D.\nFigure 4-3 Sample Procedure for Integration Testing\nZK-4070-GE\n4.3.2 Incremental Approach to Integration Testing\nThe recommended approach to integration testing is called incremental testing.\nIncremental testing involves testing the procedure by starting with one unit\nand building on it one unit at a time.

When\nyou have completed the last step, you know that the entire procedure works\ncorrectly.\nBecause you started at the top of the sample procedure and added units\nincrementally from lower levels, you were using the top-down approach to\nintegration testing. You could just as easily have started at Level 3 and used the\nbottom-up approach.\nAs you can see from the example, there are several distinct advantages to\nincremental integration testing:\ne [tis not necessary to wait until the procedure is complete to begin integration\ntesting.\n¢ Debugging is simplified by incremental testing because the modules and\ninterfaces can be tested as the system grows.\n¢« Programming errors in the interfaces and incorrect assumptions between\nunits are discovered at an early stage.\n¢« Because previously tested units are retested when new units are added, the\nprobability of discovering less obvious errors is increased substantially.\n4.4 Testing for Reentrancy\nIt is important to test your procedures for reentrancy before placing them into\na library facility.

You can use\nthe OpenVMS Debugger or perform a manual desk check.\n4.4.1.1 Using the Debugger to Check for AST Reentrancy\nWhen using the debugger to check for AST reentrancy, do the following:\n1. Create an activation of the procedure.\n2. Set watchpoints on all storage used by the procedure.\n3. Create a second activation of the procedure using the CALL command.

Execute one instruction in the first activation using the debugger STEP\ncommand.\n5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until the end of the procedure for the first activation.\nFor more information about the debugger, refer to the OpenVMS Debugger\nManual.\n4.4.1.2 Using Desk Checking to Check for AST Reentrancy\nDesk checking is the term for tracing through a procedure’s execution manually.\nPerforming a desk check for AST reentrancy consists of the following four steps:\n1.

An AST-reentrant environment can support only two threads of\nexecution: the AST-level thread and the non-AST-level thread.

These are the same statistics that are returned by\nLIBS$SHOW_VM. Unlike LIB$SHOW_VM, which returns the statistics in\nformatted form to SYS$OUTPUT, LIB$STAT_VM returns the specified\nstatistic in a signed longword integer.\nLIB$SHOW_TIMER\nLIB$SHOW_TIMER is a time monitoring procedure that returns the times\nand counts accumulated since the last call to LIB$INIT_TIMER and displays\nthem on SYS$OUTPUT.

The linker resolves\nreferences to procedures in these libraries when it searches user libraries\nspecified in the LINK command, or when it searches the default system libraries.\nThe program can then call library procedures at run time.\nCompaq supplies several procedure libraries, such as the Run-Time Library,\nthat support components of the OpenVMS operating system. You can use\nprocedures in the Run-Time Library to perform frequently used operations by\nincluding calls to Run-Time Library procedures in your program. The linker\nautomatically searches the default libraries to resolve references to Run-Time\nLibrary procedures. (For information about the procedures available in the\nRun-Time Library, see the OpfVMS Programming Concepts Manual.)\nThis chapter briefly describes how you can create your own procedure libraries\nand shareable images.

If a\nprocedure is upwardly compatible, changes and updates to the procedure do not\naffect executing and using previous versions of that procedure.\nFor example, imagine a user-written procedure named LIB_TOTAL_BILL. The\ncalling sequence for this procedure is as follows:\nCALL LIB_TOTAL_BILL (sale, tax)\nAssume that the user who wrote this procedure decided to update the procedure\nso that it could be used to calculate the total bill for credit-card customers. To\ndo this, a third argument, interest, must be added. To be upwardly compatible,\nadd", "start_char": 140400, "end_char": 142600}

To\ndo this, a third argument, interest, must be added. To be upwardly compatible,\nadding the argument interest must not conflict with the way the procedure was\npreviously run. The new calling sequence would be as follows:\nCALL LIB_TOTAL_BILL (sale, tax [,interest])\nThe procedure should be written so that the user can still call the procedure as it\nwas called before, simply omitting the interest argument.\nIf, in the updated version of this procedure, the user can still follow the\ncalling sequence of the previous versions, the procedure is said to be upwardly\ncompatible.\nTo ensure that your procedures are compatible with future versions of a shareable\nimage, see the OpenVMS Linker Utility Manual.\n6.2 Regression Testing\nRegression testing is a method of ensuring that new features added to a procedure\ndo not affect the correct execution of previously tested features. In regression\ntesting, you run established software tests and compare test results with expected\nresults. If the actual results do not agree with what you expected, the software\nbeing tested may have errors. If errors do exist, the software being tested is said\nto have regressed.\nMaintaining Modular Procedures 6-1\n\nMaintaining Modular Procedures\n6.2 Regression Testing\nRegression testing includes the following steps, as shown in Figure 6-1:\n1. Create tests by writing command files to test your software.\n2. Organize files to allow easy access to tests as they are needed.\n3. Run tests as follows:\n¢ Torun a single test, submit its command file to the batch queue.\n¢ Torun multiple tests, create a command file that submits each test to the\nbatch queue.\n4. Calculate the expected test results either by hand or by using previously\ntested software.\n5. Compare actual test results to the results you expected. If there are\ninconsistencies, repeat your calculation in step 4. If the inconsistency still\nexists, examine the changes you have made to the software to discover the\nerror.\nFigure 6-1 Regression Testing\nOrganize Calculate\nTests Test\nResults\nCompare", "start_char": 142350, "end_char": 144550}

If you do not do so, the\nprocedure may regress while the errors go undetected.\n6.3 Adding Arguments to Existing Routines\nDuring the normal course of maintenance, it sometimes becomes necessary to\npass new or additional information to an existing procedure rather than create a\nnew procedure. This new information can be passed to the procedure in one of\nthe following two ways:\n¢ Directly, by adding new arguments to the procedure\ne Indirectly, using an argument block\n6-2 Maintaining Modular Procedures\n\nMaintaining Modular Procedures\n6.3 Adding Arguments to Existing Routines\n6.3.1 Adding New Arguments to the Procedure\nThere are two rules you must follow when directly adding new arguments toa\nprocedure:\n¢« New arguments must be added at the end of the existing argument list.\ne« New arguments must be optional.\nIt is important that new arguments be added at the end of the existing argument\nlist to maintain upward compatibility. If you change the order of the existing\narguments by placing the new argument at the beginning or middle of the list,\nall applications written with the previous version of the procedure will no longer\nwork.\nYour procedure should also treat the new argument as an optional argument. If\nthe new argument is required, applications that used the previous version of the\nprocedure are invalidated.\nBecause you cannot assume that all previously written applications will be\nrewritten to include the procedure’s new argument, the procedure must test for\nthe argument’s presence before attempting to access it. If the procedure does not\nverify the presence of the new argument and attempts to access that argument\nwhen it is not present, the results will be unpredictable.\nThe passing mechanism of the new argument must conform to the guidelines in\nSection 2.2.1.\n6.3.2 Usi", "start_char": 144300, "end_char": 146500}

When an argument block is used, the calling program passes a single\nargument to the called procedure. This argument is the address of an argument\nblock. The argument block is a block of information containing any information\nagreed on by the calling and called procedures. This information is required by\nthe called procedure to perform its task.\nThe argument block is simply a contiguous piece of virtual memory. The\ninformation contained in the argument block can be numeric or scalar data,\ndescriptors, bit vectors, and so on. The format is agreed on by the users of the\nprocedure and its writer.\nThe first longword in the argument block contains the length of the block. The\nlength can be in bytes or longwords, but it must be agreed on by both the calling\nprogram and the called process, and be implemented and documented as such.\nOne example of an argument block is the signal argument vector used in\ncondition handling. A condition handler is called with a signal argument vector\nand a mechanism argument vector. Each vector is an example of an argument\nblock. The signal argument vector in Figure 6-2 is an example of an argument\nblock.\nMaintaining Modular Procedures 6-3\n\nMaintaining Modular Procedures\n6.3 Adding Arguments to Existing Routines\nFigure 6-2 One Type of Argument Block, the Signal Argument Vector\nNumber of longwords of information following\nCondition Value\nOptional Arguments Providing\nAdditional Information About\nthe Exception\nProgram Counter (PC) at exception\nProgram Status Longword (PSL) at exception\nZK-4030-GE\nThe signal argument vector contains the number of longwords of actual\ninformation in its first longword.

As with adding new\narguments directly to a procedure, the calling program may have been written to\npass the previous, shorter argument block. If your procedure does not check and\nattempts to access information past the end of the actual argument block, the\nresults will be unpredictable.\n6.4 Updating Libraries\nAny time you make modifications or enhancements to modular procedures that\nare a part of a library, you must update the library containing the procedures to\nreflect the new or changed procedures.\n6.4.1 Updating Object Libraries\nIf the updated procedures are in an object library, the library must be updated\nso that subsequent access to that library by LINK or other commands will access\nthe object modules for the new or changed procedures.\nTo update an object library, use the LIBRARY command with the REPLACE\nqualifier, as follows:\n$ LIBRARY /REPLACE library-name filespec[,...]\nIn this example, library-name is the name you have given the library. The default\nfile type for library-name is OLB. The name of an object module is filespec. The\ndefault file type for filespec is OB) .\n6-4 Maintaining Modular Procedures\n\nMaintaining Modular Procedures\n6.4 Updating Libraries\n6.4.2 Updating Shareable Images\nIf the updated procedures are part of a shareable image, you must relink the\nshareable image so that it contains the new or changed versions of any updated\nobject modules. If you add new procedures, you must update and recompile the\ntransfer vector (on VAX systems) or symbol vector (on Alpha systems) before\nrelinking the shareable image. If you add new modules, you must update the\nlinker options file before relinking.

In particular, to operate as specified, a procedure neither\nmakes assumptions about, or places requirements on, the calling program.\nA procedure should not call other procedures or system services if the\nresulting combination violates this standard from the calling program's\nviewpoint.

The first procedure saves the contents of any still-\nactive static storage on a push-down stack in heap storage, and the last\nprocedure restores the old contents of static storage Static storage is\nmade available for implicit arguments to be passed from one procedure\nto the next in the sequence of calls (unknown to the calling program).\nHowever, if an exception can occur anywhere in the sequence, the calling\nprogram must establish a condition handler that calls the last procedure\nin the event of a stack unwind (to restore the old contents of static\nstorage).\nA.1.2 Initializing\nIf a procedure requires initialization once for each image activation, it is done\nwithout the caller’s knowledge by one of the following:\n— Initializing at compile time\n— Initializing at link time\n— Adding a dispatch address to PSECT LIB$INITIALIZE\n— Testing and setting a statically allocated, first-time flag on each call\nA procedure must not use LIB$INITIALIZE to establish a condition handler\nbefore the main program is called if its action can conflict with that of\nother condition handlers established before the main program. For more\ninformation about initializing modular procedures, see Section 3.2.\nA.1.3 Reporting Exception Conditions\nA procedure must not print error or informational messages either directly or by\ncalling the $P UTMSG system service. It must either return a condition value in\nRO as a function value or call LIB$SIGNAL or LIB$STOP to output all messages.\n(LIB$SIGNAL and LIB$STOP can be called either directly or indirectly.) (See\nSection 2.5.)\nA.1.4 AST Reentrancy\nTo be AST reentrant, a procedure must execute correctly while allowing\nany procedure (including itself) to be called between any two instructions.\nThe other procedure can be an AST-level procedure, a condition handler, or\nanother AST-", "start_char": 156000, "end_char": 158200}

This can be done only from\nSummary of Modular Programming Guidelines A-3\n\nSummary of Modular Programming Guidelines\nA.1 Coding Rules\nVAX MACRO, and emulated instructions are not allowed. (See\nSection 3.3.4.1.)\n— Detect concurrency of database access with test and set instructions at\neach access of the database. (See Section 3.3.4.2.)\n— Keep a call-in-progress count incremented upon entry to the procedure\nand decremented upon return. (See Section 3.3.4.3.)\n-— Disable AST interrupts on entry to the procedure and restore the state of\nthe AST enables on return. (See Section 3.3.4.4.)\nIf a procedure performs I/O from the AST level by calling RMS $GET and\n$PUT system services, it must check for the record stream active error status\n(RMS$ RSA). If this error is encountered, the procedure issues the $WAIT\nsystem service and then retries the $GET or $PUT system service (See\nSection 3.3.5.)\nA procedure should not depend on AST interrupts being disabled to execute\ncorrectly if there are other coding methods available. For example, RMS\ncompletion routines are implemented via ASTs and will not work if ASTs are\ndisabled. (See Section 3.3.)\nA.1.5 Resource Allocation\nA procedure should not allocate static storage unless it is a processwide,\nresource-allocating procedure, or unless it must retain results for implicit\ninputs on subsequent invocations.\nTiming procedures and resource allocation procedures should make statistics\navailable for performance evaluation and debugging by providing the entry\npoints fac SHOW_name and fac STAT_name.

See Section 4.3.)\nIf a procedure uses a processwide resource, it calls the appropriate resource\nallocating library procedure or system service to allocate the resource to avoid\nconflict with allocations made to other procedures. To conserve resources, a\nprocedure that requests resource allocation does one of the following:\n— Calls the deallocation procedure before returning to the calling program\n— Remembers the allocation in static storage and calls the deallocation\nprocedure later\n— Passes the responsibility for deallocation back to the calling program\n— Allocates a fixed number of the resources, independent of the number of\ntimes it is called (See Section 2.4 and Section 3.1.3.)\nA.1.6 Format and Content of Coded Modules\nEach module must be documented with a module description. (See\nSection 2.5.1.)\nEach procedure must be documented with a procedure description. (See\nSection 2.5.2.)\nWhen symbol definitions are to be coordinated between more than one module\n(such as control blocks, procedure argument values, and completion status\ncodes), the definitions should be centralized in a common source file. Note,\nhowever, that the modules must be written in the same language. (See\nSection 3.1.2.)\nA-4 Summary of Modular Programming Guidelines\n\nSummary of Modular Programming Guidelines\nA.1 Coding Rules\n¢ Procedure entry point names, module names, and PSECT names must\nconform to the naming conventions.

Part II of this\nmanual describes messages that can occur before the operating system and Help\nMessage are fully functional. Messages are ordered alphabetically by message\nidentification (see Section 1.1); exceptions to this rule are noted in Section 1.1.1.\nFor users who do not have Help Message installed, Section 1.3 explains how\nto retrieve a system message. This chapter also describes how to recover from\ntypical error conditions (see Section 1.5).\n1.1 Format of System Messages\nMost messages displayed by the OpenVMS operating system have the following\nformat:\nSfacility-s-identification, text\n[-facility-s-identification, text]\nA percent sign (%) prefixes the main message, and a hyphen (-) prefixes any\nsecondary messages that provide additional information about the error.\nFor example, the HELP/MESSAGE command calls OpenVMS Record\nManagement Services (RMS) to access the database. If the database file cannot\nbe found, the MSGHLP facility displays a message indicating that it cannot\naccess the file; an RMS message and a SYSTEM message follow to in", "start_char": 17550, "end_char": 19750}

If the database file cannot\nbe found, the MSGHLP facility displays a message indicating that it cannot\naccess the file; an RMS message and a SYSTEM message follow to indicate the\nreason for the failure. In the following example, a HELP/MESSAGE command\nincludes the /LIBRARY qualifier to specify a private database, which MSGHLP\ncannot find:\n$ HELP /MESSAGE/LIBRARY=TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA ACCVIO\nSMSGHLP-F-MDFERR, error accessing Help Message database file \"TOOLS: [MYPROJ]\nMYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA\"\n-RMS-E-FNF, file not found\n-SYSTEM-W-NOSUCHFILE, no such file\nAny or all of the message fields can be suppressed by using the SET MESSAGE\ncommand (see online help or the Op VMS DCL Dictionary). The message fields\nare as follows:\nfacility\nAn OpenVMS facility or component name.\nOverview of OpenVMS System Messages 1-1\n\nOverview of OpenVMS System Messages\n1.1 Format of System Messages\ns\nA severity level indicator having one of the following values:\nCode Meaning Description\nS Success The system has successfully performed your request.

For an interactive user, this device is normally the\nterminal; for batch job users, it is the batch job log file\nIf the logical device SYS$ERROR is different from SYS$OUTPUT, the system\nwrites informational, warning, error, and fatal system messages to that device as\nwell. For example, if you execute a command procedure interactively and specify\nthe /OUTPUT qualifier, the system defines the file you specified as SYS $OUTPUT\nfor the procedure. SYS$ERROR remains assigned to your current error device.\nThen, if any errors occur during the execution of the command procedure, the\nerror messages are displayed on your terminal and are entered in the specified\nfile.\n1.3 Retrieving a System Message\nWhen a DCL command, command procedure, or applications program completes\nexecution, it returns a condition code. The condition code indicates the execution\nstatus of the command—whether it executed successfully or resulted in an error.\nEach condition code corresponds to a system message. The command interpreter\nsaves the condition code as a 32-bit longword defined as the reserved global\nsymbol $STATUS. The condition code stored in $STATUS", "start_char": 21450, "end_char": 23650}

This message is followed by a traceback; the system displays the status\nof the call frames on the stack so that you can locate the procedure where the\ncondition occurred. Refer to the ODVMS Programming Concepts Manual for a\nmore detailed discussion of condition handling.\n1.5 Recovery Procedures\nError messages generally occur for the following reasons:\n« A command is entered incorrectly; it contains a spelling or syntax error or an\nincorrect file specification. (See Section 1.5.1.)\n¢ A required resource is currently unavailable. (See Section 1.5.2.)\n¢ A programming error is detected during the execution of an image. (See\nSection 1.5.3.)\ne« A system software or hardware problem exists. (See Section 1.5.4.)\n1.5.1 Recovering from Command Entry Errors\nWhen an error occurs following interactive command entry, you must reenter the\ncommand. Messages from the command interpreter are usually followed by a\ndisplay of the portion of the command line that is rejected. Correct this portion of\nthe line before you reenter the command.\nErrors that occur while a command is executing can indicate that you have\nentered an invalid value for a parameter or qualifier. In these cases, you can use\nthe DCL command HELP or consult the Op&VMS DCL Dictionary to determine\nthe legal values before you try to reenter the command.\nErrors in file specifications or device names can occur when you enter a file name\nin a command that has a default file type, but the file name is currently defined\nas a logical name. When the system translates the logical name, the resulting file\nspecification may not be valid within the context of the command.\nThe syntax of the file specification can be invalid for any of the following reasons:\ne« A device name is not terminated with a colon.\n¢ A directory name is not enclosed in brackets.\n¢ A file name has more than 39 characters.\ne A file", "start_char": 25350, "end_char": 27550}

In some instances, the program\nmay be able to continue execution and retry the service later. Or, it may be\nnecessary only to note that the program is required to wait.\n1.5.3 Recovering from Programming Errors\nIf a program image terminates abnormally, you can get some information\nabout the error from the message. When a program image exits, the command\ninterpreter uses the current value of general register 0 to obtain information\nabout the exit status. If it is an abnormal (or error) exit, the system message\nassociated with the register 0 value is displayed.\nProgramming errors can be caused by the following conditions:\n¢ Incorrect coding of arguments for called procedures (for example, system\nservices)\ne Logic errors in programming\ne Failure to establish the correct execution environment before executing the\nimage (for example, failure to make logical name assignments", "start_char": 27300, "end_char": 29500}

In addition, the Help Message database can optionally include\nother source files, such as user-supplied messages documentation.\nThe HELP/MESSAGE command and qualifiers are described in the following\nsections, including an overview of the facility's features and examples of a few\nsimple operations. Detailed information about customizing the Help Message\ndatabase follows the qualifier descriptions. System managers can refer to the\nOpenVMS Systen Manager’s Manual for more information about customizing the\nHelp Message database.\n2.1 Features of Help Message\nBasic Help Message features are as follows:\ne By default, Help Message provides information on the status of the last\nexecuted DCL command. To obtain message information after a DCL\ncommand results in an error, enter the following:\n$ HELP/MESSAGE\nYou can abbreviate the command according to standard conventions or define\na key to evoke the basic HELP/MESSAGE command.\n« Help Message preserves the value of $STATUS, so you can incorporate", "start_char": 29250, "end_char": 31450}

Unless you specify /SORT, the output alphabetically lists the\nfacility names for the first .MSGHLP$DATA file in the database, then the second\n.MSGHLP$DATA file, and so on.\nIn addition to the facility names listed in response to /FACILIT=Y? ,\nCompaq has included a few internal nicknames to simplify access to\ncertain facilities. “DCL” is such a nickname. For example, when accessing\nMSGHLP$LIBRARY.MSGHLP$DATA, the nickname “DCL” maps to the official\nfacility name, “CLI, Command Language Interpreter (DCL)”. DCL does not\nappear in the list of facility names, but if you enter /FACILITY=DCL ina\ncommand, Help Message outputs CLI messages.\nHelp Message searches for facility names from the beginning of the facility name's\nstring only—not on each word of the string as with the message text. Therefore,\nyou must enter enough characters to narrow your search to the desired field.\nFor example, a search on /FACILITY=RMS selects messages for two facilities:\n« RMS, OpenVMS Record Management Services\n« RMSREC, RMS Recovery Utility", "start_char": 42900, "end_char": 45100}

The double quotes\nare required in order to include the comma (and any following words) in the\nsearch string. Since the double quotes direct Help Message to search for a literal\nstring, you must specify the precise capitalization used for the facility name in\nthe database.\n2.4 Accessing $STATUS Values for Uninstalled Messages\nAny messages that are not installed as part of the OpenVMS operating system\ncannot be equated with a value stored in $STATUS until they are recognized\nby the system. Such messages include user-supplied messages, third-party\nmessages, and messages from layered products and certain other OpenVMS\nfacilities. Your system manager may already have linked all the messages you\nneed at the system level. If not, you can make these links in your own account.\n(System managers who want information about linking message section files at\nthe system level should refer to the OpenVMS Systen Manager's Manual.)\nBefore linking such messages, determine whether you must frequently access\nthem using the value in $STATUS or a value specified using the /STATUS\nqualifier. If not, the simplest alternative is to use the HELP/MESSAGE command\nand specify the message identifier or message text in the search string.\nIf you prefer the convenience of having Help Message interpret a $STATUS\nvalue, there are two ways that you can make the system recognize uninstalled\nmessages:\ne The simplest method is to use the SET MESSAGE command to link an\nunknown messages .E XE file. For example:\n$ SET MESSAGE TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYNEWMSG.EXE\nThis command includes the messages pointed to by file MYNEWMSG.E XE\nas part of the system until you enter another SET MESSAGE command\nspecifying a different file.\n2-8 Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)\n\nHelp Message Utility (MSGHLP)\n2.4 Accessing $STATUS Values for Uninstalled Me", "start_char": 44850, "end_char": 47050}

If you have\nwrite access to the .MSGHLP$DATA files, you can customize the database by\ninserting or deleting data contained in .MSGHLLP files. (.MSGHLP files are\ndescribed later in this section.)\nThe system manager can define a system logical name to set up a system-\nwide Help Message database that includes all or selected .MSGHLP$DATA\nfiles in a search path. You can also set a logical name in your login file to\ninclude or exclude specific .MSGHLP$DATA files in your personalized Help\nMessage database (see Section 2.5.2).\n¢ .MSGHLLP files\nA .MSGHLP file is used as input to change the content of a.MSGHLP$DATA\nfile. The contents of a .MSGHLP file are applied to a .MSGHLP$DATA\nfile either as data to be inserted or as data to be deleted from the\n-MSGHLP$DATA file. Various options are described in subsections to\nSection 2.6.\nBy setting up different search paths for multiple .MSGHLP$DATA files at the\nsystem or process level, you can create a variety of Help Message databases.\nThe Help Message qualifier /LIBRARY allows you to access or change a specific\n.MSGHLP$DATA file or search path. For more information, see Section 2.5.2.\n2.5.1 Creating a .MSGHLP File\nThere are two ways to create a .MSGHLP file, depending upon the purpose for\nwhich you intend to use the file, as follows:\n« Usethe/EXTRACT qualifier with the HELP/MESSAGE command.\nUse this method when you want to modify or delete information in the\ndatabase.\n2-10 Help Message Utility (MSGHLP)\n\nHelp Message Utility (MSGHLP)\n2.5 Customizing the Help Message Database\nUsers with write access to Compag supplied .MSGHLP$DATA files can use a\n-.MSGHLP file created in this fashion to add a comment to a Compaq supplied\nmessage or to delete Compaq supplied information from the database.

Also avoid\nusing a long facility name that wraps to a second line.\nOther sections in this chapter explain how you can use the contents of a\n-MSGHLP file, edited or unedited, to add data to or delete data from a\n-MSGHLP$DATA file.\n2.5.2 Defining a Search Path in Your Login File\nThe Help Message database comprises one or more .MSGHLP$DATA files that\ncan be accessed individually by the .MSGHLP$DATA file name or collectively\nby a search path that includes one or more .MSGHLP$DATA files.

Once you have created the .MSGHLP$DATA files, you can create a logical\nname in your login file (SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM) to define a search path\nthat names the .MSGHLP$DATA files you want to include in your customized\ndatabase.\nFor example, the following command in your login file defines your Help Message\ndefault search path to include the main OpenVMS messages file and another file\ncalled MYMESSAGES.MSGHLP$DATA:\n$ DEFINE MSGHLPSLIBRARY SYSSCOMMON: [SYSHLP]MSGHLPSLIBRARY .MSGHLPSDATA, -—\n_$ TOOLS: [MYPROJ]MYMESSAGES .MSGHLPSDATA\nHelp Message Utility (MSGHLP) 2-11\n\nHelp Message Utility (MSGHLP)\n2.5 Customizing the Help Message Database\nYou can set up multiple logical names to create customized search paths that\nrestrict the Help Message database to minimize search time or that add personal\n.MSGHLP$DATA files to the database. For example, the following logical name\nomits the main OpenVMS messages file and names two other .MSGHLP$DATA\nfiles instead:\n$ DEFINE MSGHLP_ABCDEF TOOLS: [MYPROJ]ABC.TOMOLSS: G[MHYPRLOJP] SDEFD .AMSGTHLAPS,DAT A\nIf you want Help Message to search all .MSGHLP$DATA files in a directory, you\ncan define a logical name that points to the directory, but does not name specific\nfiles.

These messages appear if the SYSGEN parameter DUMPSTYLE is\nset so that a selective dump (that is, a dump of selected portions of system\nspace and process address space in virtual memory) is written.\nA selective dump is similar to a complete dump when writing the dump\nheader and system error log buffers. Following these items, it differs from\nthe complete dump by immediately writing out the system and global page\ntables. The page tables and system space are the minimum content needed\nto analyze a crash dump; configuring your dump file so that this minimum\ncannot be dumped causes the dump to be useless.\nThe global pages written during the dump are written separately from the\nprocesses that might reference them. This allows a single copy of each global\npage to exist in the dump. Processes are selected to have their PO and P1\nspaces dumped in the following order: current processes (if any) on the CPU\nthat initiated the bugcheck, special system processes, current processes (if\nany) on other CPUs, and any other processes. A message giving the name of\nthe process follows the writing of the dump for that process if it completed\nsuccessfully .\nGlobal and process pages are optional when writing a dump because the\ndump may still yield useful information if they are not present. However,\nCompaq recommends that you use a dump file at least as large as the one\ncreated by AUTOGEN. If the dump file is not large enough to hold all process\nand page files, the dump is still considered to have finished normally.\nUser Action: None.
